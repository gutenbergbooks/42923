<p class="h1">THE DOCTOR&#39;S CHRISTMAS EVE</p>

<h2>I</h2>

<p class="h2">THE CHILDREN OF DESIRE</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> morning of the twenty-fourth of December
a quarter of a century ago opened upon the
vast plateau of central Kentucky as a brilliant
but bitter day&mdash;with a wind like the gales of
March.</p>

<p class="indent">Out in a neighborhood of one of the wealthiest
and most thickly settled counties, toward the
middle of the forenoon, two stumpy figures with
movements full of health and glee appeared on a
hilltop of the treeless landscape. They were the
children of the neighborhood physician, a man
of the highest consequence in his part of the
world; and they had come from their home, a
white and lemon-colored eighteenth-century
manor house a mile in their rear. Through the
crystalline air the chimneys of this low structure,
rising out of a green girdle of cedar trees,
could be seen emptying unusual smoke which
the wind in its gambolling pounced upon and
jerked away level with the chimney-tops.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span>
But if you had stood on the hill where the
two children climbed into view and if your eye
could have swept round the horizon with adequate
radius of vision, it would everywhere have
been greeted by the same wondrous harmonious
spectacle: out of the chimneys of all dwellings
scattered in comfort and permanence over that
rich domestic land&mdash;a land of Anglo-Saxon
American homes&mdash;more than daily winter
smoke was pouring: one spirit of preparation,
one mood of good will, warmed houses and
hearts. The whole visible heaven was receiving
the incense of Kentucky Christmas fires; the
whole visible earth was a panorama of the
common peace.</p>

<p class="indent">The two dauntless, frost-defying wayfarers&mdash;what
Emerson, meeting them in the depths of a
New England winter, might have called two
scraps of valor&mdash;were following across fields
and meadows and pastures one of the footpaths
which children who are friendly neighbors
naturally make in order to get to each other,
as the young of wild creatures trace for themselves
upon the earth some new map of old
hereditary traits and cravings. For the goal
of their journey they were hurrying toward a
house not yet in sight but hardly more than a
mile ahead, where they were to spend Christmas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span>
Day and share in an old people&#39;s and children&#39;s
Christmas-Tree party on Christmas Night&mdash;and
where also they were to put into execution
a plot of their own: about which a good deal is
to be narrated.</p>

<p class="indent">They were thus transferring the nation&#39;s
yearly festival of the home from their own roof-tree
to that of another family as the place where
it could be enacted and enjoyed. The tragical
meaning of this arrangement was but too well
understood by their parents. To them the
abandonment of their own fireside at the season
when its bonds should have been freshened and
deepened scarcely seemed an unnatural occurrence.
The other house had always been to
them as a secondary home. It was the residence
of their father&#39;s friend, a professor in the State
University situated some miles off across fine
country. His two surviving children, a boy and
a girl of about their own ages, had always been
their intimate associates. And the woman of
that household&mdash;the wife, the mother&mdash;all
their lives they had been mysteriously impelled
toward this gentlewoman by a power of which
they were unconscious but by which they had
been swayed.</p>

<p class="indent">The little girl wore a crimson hood and a
brown cloak and the boy a crimson skull cap
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
and a brown overcoat; and both wore crimson
mittens; and both were red-legged and red-footed;
for stockings had been drawn over
their boots to insure warmth and to provide
safeguard against slipping when they should
cross the frozen Elkhorn or venture too friskily
on silvery pools in the valley bottoms.</p>

<p class="indent">The chestnut braids of the girl falling heavily
from under her hood met in a loop in the middle
of her broad fat back and were tied there with
a snip of ribbon that looked like a feather out
of the wing of a bluejay. Her bulging hips
overreached the borders of the narrow path,
so that the boy was crowded out upon the rough
ground as he struggled forward close beside her.
She would not allow him to walk in front of
her and he disdained to walk behind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then walk beside me or go back!&quot; she
had said to him, laughing carelessly.</p>

<p class="indent">She looked so tight inside her wrappings, so
like a jolly ambulatory small barrel well hooped
and mischievously daubed here and there with
vermilion, that you might have had misgivings
as to the fate of the barrel, were it to receive
a violent jolt and be rolled over. No thought
of such mishap troubled her as she trotted forward,
balancing herself as lightly on her cushioned
feet as though she were wind-carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
thistledown. Nor was she disturbed by her
selfishness in monopolizing the path and forcing
her brother to encounter whatsoever the winter
earth obtruded&mdash;stumps of forest trees, brambles
of blackberry, sprouts of cane, or stalks
of burdock and of Spanish needle. His footing
was especially troublesome when he tried to
straddle wide corn-rows with his short legs;
or when they crossed a hemp-field where the
butt-ends of the stalks serried the frost-gray
soil like bayonet points. Altogether his exertions
put him out of breath somewhat, for his
companion was fleet and she made no allowance
for his delays and difficulties.</p>

<p class="indent">Her hands, deep in the fleece-lined mittens,
were comfortably warm; but she moreover
kept them thrust into a muff of white fur, which
also looked overfed and seemed of a gay harmony
with its owner. This muff she now and
then struck against her flexed knees in a vixenish
playfulness as one beats a tambourine on
a bent elbow; and at a certain point of the
journey, having glanced sidewise at him and
remarked his breath on the icy air, she lifted
it to her mouth and spoke guardedly from
behind it:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Remember the last thing Papa told us at
the window, Herbert: we were to keep our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
mouths closed and to breathe through our
noses. And remember also, my child, that we
were to rely upon&mdash;<i>especially</i> to rely upon&mdash;the
ribs and the diaphragm! I wonder why
he thought it necessary to tell us that! Did he
suppose that as soon as we got by ourselves
or arrived at the Ousleys&#39;, we&#39;d begin to rely
upon something else, and perhaps try to breathe
with our spines and elbows?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her eyes sparkled with mischief, and her
laughter had the audacity of a child&#39;s satire,
often more terrible in its small world than a
sage&#39;s in his larger one. The instant she spoke,
you recognized the pertness and precocity of
an American child&mdash;which, when seen at its
best or at its worst, is without precedent or
parallel among the world&#39;s children. She was
the image of a hard bold crisp newness. Her
speech was new, her ideas were new, her impertinence
was new&mdash;except in this country. She
appeared to have gathered newness during her
short life, to be newer than the day she was born.
The air was full of frost spangles that zigzagged
about her as she danced along; they rather
seemed like particles of salt especially provided
to escort her character. If it had been granted
Lot&#39;s wife with tears of repentance to dissolve
away the crystals of her curiosity and resume
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
the duties of motherhood,&mdash;though possibly
permeated by a mild saline solution as a warning,&mdash;that
salt-cured matron might admirably
have adapted herself to the decrees of Providence
by producing Elsie.</p>

<p class="indent">The boy as she administered her caution
stopped; and shutting his own red mouth,
which was like hers though more generous,
he drew a long breath through his nostrils;
then, throwing back his head, he blew this out
with an open-mouthed puff, and a column of
white steam shot up into the blue ether and
was whirled away by the wind. He stood
studying it awhile as it disappeared, for he was
a close observer always&mdash;a perpetual watcher
of the thing that is&mdash;sometimes an observer
fearful to confront. Then he sprang forward
to catch up with his sharp-tongued monitress,
who had hurried on. As he came alongside,
he turned his face toward her and made his
reply, which was certainly deliberate enough in
arriving:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have to be <i>taught</i> the best way to breathe,
Elsie; as anything else!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The defence only brought on a fresh
attack:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder who teaches the young of other
animals how to breathe! I should like to know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
who teaches kittens and puppies and calves
and lambs how to breathe! How <i>do</i> they ever
manage to get along without country doctors
among them! Imagine a middle-aged sheep&mdash;old
Dr. Buck&mdash;assembling a flock of lambs
and trying to show them how to breathe!&quot;
Judging from Elsie&#39;s expression, the lambs in
the case could not have thought very highly of
this queer and genial Dr. Buck.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But <i>they</i> are all four-legged creatures, Elsie;
and <i>they</i> breathe backward and forward; if
you are a two-legged animal and stand up
straight, you breathe up and down: it&#39;s quite
different! It&#39;s easier!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I suppose the fewer legs a thing has,
the harder it is to get its breath. And I suppose
if we ventured to stand on <i>one</i> leg, we&#39;d
all soon suffocate! Dear me! why <i>don&#39;t</i> all
one-legged people die at once!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The lad looked over the field of war on which
it would seem that he was being mowed down
by small-gun fire before he could get his father&#39;s
heavy artillery into action. He decided to
terminate the wordy engagement, a prudential
man&oelig;uvre of the wiser head but slower tongue.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father is right,&quot; he declared. His manner
of speaking was sturdy and decisive: it was
meant to remind her first that he had enough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
gallantry as a male to permit her to crowd
him out of the path; but that the moment a
struggle for mental footing arose between them,
he reserved the whole road: the female could
take to the weeds! He notified her also that
he stood with his father not only in this puzzling
question of legs and parlous types of respiration,
but that the men in the family were regularly
combined against the women&mdash;like good organized
against evil!</p>

<p class="indent">But now something further had transpired.
Had there been present on the winter fields
that morning an ear trained to separate our
complex human tones into simple ones&mdash;to
disengage one from another the different fibres
of meaning which always make up even the
slenderest tendril of sound (as there is a cluster
of grapes to a solitary stem), it might, as it
noted one thing, have discovered another.
While the boy asserted his father to be right
in the matter they were debating, there escaped
from him an accent of admission that his father
was wrong&mdash;wrong in some far graver affair
which was his discovery and his present trouble.</p>

<p class="indent">Therefore his voice, which should have been
buoyant, for the instant was depressed; and
his face, which should have been a healthy
boy&#39;s happy face, was overcast as by a foreign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
interference. You might have likened it to a
small luminary upon the shining disk of which
a larger body, traversing its darkened orbit,
has just begun to project a wavering shadow.
And thus some patient astronomer of our inter-orbited
lives, sweeping the spiritual heavens
for signs of its pendent mysteries, here might
have arrested his telescope to watch the portent
of a celestial event: was there to take place the
eclipse of a son by a father?</p>

<p class="indent">Certainly at least this weight of responsibility
on the voice must have caused it to strike only
the more winningly upon any hearer. It was
such a devoted, loyal voice when he thus spoke
of his father, with a curious quavering huskiness
of its own, as though the bass note of his distant
manhood were already beginning to clamor
to be heard.</p>

<p class="indent">The voice of the little girl contrariwise was a
shrill treble. Had you first become aware of
it at your back, you must instantly have wheeled
to investigate the small creature it came from,
as a wild animal quickly turns to face any sound
that startles its instincts. Voltaire might have
had such a voice if he had been a little girl.
Yet to look at her, you would never have
imagined that anything but the honey of speech
could have dripped from so perfect a little rose.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
(Many surprises await mankind behind round
amiable female faces: shrews are not <i>all</i> thin.)</p>

<p class="indent">Instead of being silenced by her brother&#39;s ultimatum,
she did not deign to notice it, but continued
to direct her voluble satire at her father&mdash;quite
with the air of saying that a girl who can
satirize a parent is not to be silenced by a son.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;... forever telling us that American
children must have the newest and best way of
doing everything.... My, my, my! The
working of our jaws! And the drinking and
the breathing; and the stretching and the
bending: developing everything we have&mdash;and
everything we haven&#39;t! I am even trying
now to find an original American way to go
to sleep at night and to wake up in the morning!
Dear me, but old people can be silly without
knowing it!&quot; She laughed with much self-approval.</p>

<p class="indent">For Elsie had already entered into one of
mankind&#39;s most dependable recreations&mdash;the
joy of listening to our own words: into that
economic arrangement of nature whereby whatsoever
a human being might lose through the
vocal cords is returned to the owner along the
auditory nerve! So that a woman can eat her
colloquial cake times over: and each time,
having devoured it, can return it to the storeroom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
and have it brought out as whole and fresh
as ever&mdash;sometimes actually increased in size.
And a man can send his vocal Niagara through
his whirlpool rapids and catch it again above
the falls! The more gold the delver unearths,
the more he can empty back into the thinking
mine. One can sit in his own cranial theatre
and produce his own play: he can be stage and
orchestra, audience and critic; and he can see
that the claque does not get drowsy and slack:
it never does&mdash;in <i>this</i> case!</p>

<p class="indent">The child now threw back her round winter-rose
of a face and started along the path with a
fresh outburst of speed and pride. Access of
impertinence seemed to have released in her
access of vitality. Perhaps it had. Perhaps
it always does. Perhaps life itself at the full
is sheer audacity.</p>

<p class="indent">The lad scrambled roughly along, and merely
repeated the words that sufficed for him:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father knows.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly he gave a laughing outcry, and stood
still.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look!&quot; he called out, with amusement at
his plight.</p>

<p class="indent">He had run into some burdock, and the nettles
had stuck to his yarn stockings like stinging
bees&mdash;a cluster of them about his knees and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
calves. He drew off his gloves, showing the
strong, overgrown hands of boyhood: they,
like his voice, seemed impatiently reaching out
for maturity.</p>

<p class="indent">When he overtook his companion, who had
not stopped, he had transferred a few of the burrs
to his skull cap. He had done this with crude
artistry&mdash;from some faint surviving impulse
of primitive man to decorate his body with
things around him in nature: especially his
head (possibly he foresaw that his head
would be most struck at). The lad was pleased
with his caper; and, smiling, thrust his head
across her path, expecting her to take sympathetic
notice. He had reason to expect this,
because on dull rainy days at home he often
amused her with the things he did and the things
he made: for he was a natural carpenter and
toy-maker. But now she took only the contemptuous
notice of disapproval. This morning
her mind was intent on playthings of positive
value: she was a little travelling ten-toed
pagoda of holiday greed. Every Christmas she
prepared for its celebration with a balancing
eye to what it would cost her and what it would
bring in: she always calculated to receive more
than she gave: for Elsie, the Nativity must
be made <i>to pay</i>!</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
He resented her refusal to approve his playfulness
by so much as a smile, and he came
back at her by doing worse:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why didn&#39;t I think to bring all the burrs
along and make a Christmas basket for Elizabeth?
Now what will I give her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This drew out a caustic comment quickly
enough:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor Elizabeth!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A child resents injustice with a blow or rage
or tears: the old have learned to endure without
a sign&mdash;waiting for God&#39;s day of judgment
(or their first good opportunity!).</p>

<p class="indent">He was furious at the way she said &quot;Poor
Elizabeth&quot;&mdash;as though Elizabeth&#39;s hands would
be empty of gifts from him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You <i>know</i> I have <i>bought</i> my presents for
Elizabeth, Elsie!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;But Elizabeth
thinks more of what I <i>make</i> than of what
I <i>buy</i>,&quot; he continued hotly. &quot;And the less it
is worth, the more she values it. But you can&#39;t
understand <i>that</i>, Elsie! And you needn&#39;t try!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The little minx laughed with triumph that
she had incensed him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t expect to try!&quot; she retorted blithely.
&quot;I don&#39;t see that I&#39;d gain anything, if I <i>did</i>
understand. You and Elizabeth are a great
deal too&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
He interrupted overbearingly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Leave Elizabeth out! Confine your remarks
to me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My remarks will be wholly unconfined,&quot;
said Elsie, as she trotted forward.</p>

<p class="indent">He scrambled alongside in silent rage. Perhaps
he was thinking of his inability to reach
protected female license. He may obscurely
have felt that life&#39;s department of justice was
being balked at the moment by its department
of natural history&mdash;a not uncommon interference
in this too crowded world. At least
he put himself on record about it:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you were a boy, Elsie, you&#39;d get taken
down a buttonhole!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you worry about my buttonholes!&quot;
chirped Elsie. &quot;My buttonholes are where
they ought to be!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was not the first time that he had made
something of this sort for Elizabeth. One morning
of the May preceding he had pulled apart
the boughs of a blooming lilac bush in the yard,
and had seen a nest with four pale-green eggs.
That autumn during a ramble in the woods
and fields he had taken burrs and made a nest
and deposited in it four pale-green half-ripe
horse chestnuts.</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth, who did not amount to much in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
this world but breath and a soft cloud of hair
and sentiment, had loyally carried it off to her
cabinet of nests. These were duly arranged
on shelves, and labelled according to species
and life and love: &quot;The Meadow Lark&#39;s&quot;&mdash;&quot;The
Blue-bird&#39;s&quot;&mdash;&quot;The Orchard Oriole&#39;s&quot;&mdash;&quot;The
Brown Thrasher&#39;s&quot;; on and on along
the shelves. At the end of a row she placed
this treasured curiosity, and inscribed it, &quot;An
Imitation by a Young Animal.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth&#39;s humor was a mild beam.</p>

<p class="indent">Do country children in that part of the world
make such playthings now? Do they still
look to wild life and not wholly to the shops
of cities for the satisfying of their instincts for
toys and games and fancies?</p>

<p class="indent">Do alder stalks still race down dusty country
lanes as thoroughbred colts, afterwards to be
tied in their stalls in fence corners with halters
of green hemp? Does any little rustic instrument-maker
now draw melodies from a homegrown
corn-stalk? Across rattling window-panes
of old farm-houses&mdash;between withered
sashes&mdash;during long winter nights does there
sound the æolian harp made with a hair from
a horse-tail? Do boys still squeeze the red
juice of poke-berries on the plumage of white
barnyard roosters, thus whenever they wish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
bringing on a cock-fight between old far-squandered
Cochins, who long previously had
entered into a treaty as to their spheres of
influence in a Manchuria of hens? Do the
older boys some wet night lead the youngest
around the corner of the house in the darkness
and show him, there! rising out of the ground!
the long expected Devil come at last (as a pumpkin
carved and candle-lighted) for his own
particular urchin? When in autumn the great
annual ceremony of the slaughter of the swine
takes place on the farms at the approach of the
winter solstice,&mdash;a festival running back to
aboriginal German tribes before the beginnings
of agriculture, when the stock that had been
fattened on the mast and pasturage of the mountains
was driven down into the villages and
perforce killed to keep it from starving,&mdash;when
this carnival of flesh recurs on Kentucky farms,
do boys with turkey-quills or goose-quills blow
the bladders up, tie the necks and hang them in
smoke-houses or garrets to dry; and then at
daybreak of Christmas morning, having warmed
and expanded them before the fire, do they
jump on them and explode them&mdash;a primitive
folk-rite for making a magnificent noise
ages older than the use of crackers and
cannon?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
Do children contrive their picture-frames by
glueing October acorns and pine-cones to ovals
of boards and giving the mass a thick coat of
varnish? On winter nights do little girls count
the seeds of the apples they are eating and pronounce
over them the incantation of their destinies&mdash;thus
in another guise going through
the same charm of words that Marguerite used as
she scattered earthward the petals of trust and
ruin? Do they, sitting face to face bareheaded
on sun-hued meadows, pluck the dandelion
when its seed are clustered at the top like a ball
of gauze, and with one breath try to blow these
off: for the number of seed that remain will
tell the too many years before they shall be
asked in marriage? Do they slit the stems and
cast them into the near brook and watch them
form into ringlets and floating hair&mdash;as of a
water spirit? Do they hold buttercups under
each other&#39;s chins to see who likes butter&mdash;that
is, mind you, <i>good</i> butter! Romping little
Juliets of Nature&#39;s proud courtyards&mdash;with
young Montagues watching from afar! Sane
little Ophelias of the garland at the water&#39;s
brink&mdash;secure for many years yet from all sad
Hamlets! Do country children do such things
and have such notions now?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
Perhaps once in a lifetime, on some summer
day when the sky was filled with effulgence and
white clouds, you may have seen a large low-flying
bird cross the landscape straight away
from you, so exactly poised under the edge of
a cloud, that one of the wings beat in shadow
while the other waved in light. Thus these
two children, following their path over the fields
that morning, ran along the dividing-line between
the darkness and the light of their world.</p>

<p class="indent">On one side of them lay the thinning shadow
of man&#39;s ancient romance with Nature which
is everywhere most rapidly dying out in this
civilization&mdash;the shadow of that romance
which for ages was the earliest ray of his religion:
in later centuries became the splendor
of his art; then loomed as the historic background
of his titanic myths and fables; and
now only in obscure valleys is found lingering
in the play of superstitious children at twilights
before darkness engulfs them&mdash;the latest of
the infants in the dusk of the oldest gods.</p>

<p class="indent">On the other side blazed the hard clear light
of that realism of human life which is the unfolding
brightness of the New World; that
light of reason and of reasonableness which
seems to take from man both his mornings and
his evenings, with all their half-lights and their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
mysteries; and to leave him only a perpetual
noonday of the actual in which everything
loses its shadow. So the two ran that morning.
But so children ever run&mdash;between the fresh
light and the old darkness of ever-advancing
humanity&mdash;between the world&#39;s new birth
and a forgetting.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">On the brother and sister skipped and
bounded, wild with health and Christmas joy.
Their quarrel was in a moment forgotten&mdash;happy
children! The nature of the little girl
was not deep enough to remember a quarrel;
the boy&#39;s nature was too deep to remember one.
Crimson-tipped, madcap, winter spirits! The
blue dome vaulting infinitely above them with
all its clouds pushed aside; the wind throwing
itself upon them at every step like some huge
young animal force unchained for exercise and
rude in its good-natured play. As they crossed
a woodland pasture the hoary trees rocked
and roared, strewing in their path bits of bark
and rotten twigs and shattered sprigs of mistletoe.
In an open meadow a yellow-breasted
lark sprang reluctantly from its cuddling-place
and drifted far behind them on the rushing air.
In a corn-field out of a dried bunch of partridge
grass a rabbit started softly and went bobbing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
away over the corn-rows&mdash;with its white flag
run up at the rear end of the fortifications as a
notice &quot;Please not to shoot or otherwise trespass!&quot;
Alas, that so palpable and polite a
request should be treated as so plain a target!</p>

<p class="indent">Once the little girl changed her trotting gait
to a walk nearly as fast, so that her skirts swished
from side to side of her plump hips with wren-like
energy and briskness. Her mind was still
harping on her father; and having satirized
him, and adoring him, she now would fain
approve him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My! but it&#39;s cold, Herbert! Papa says it is
not sickness that plays havoc with you: it&#39;s not
being ready for sickness; and being ready depends
upon how you have lived: it depends upon what
you are; and that&#39;s where your virtue comes in,
my child, if you have any virtue. We have been
taught to stay out of doors when it is cold; and
now we can come out when it is colder. We
were ready for the crisis!&quot; and Elsie pushed her
nose into the air with smallish amusement.</p>

<p class="indent">The boy gravely pondered her words about
crisis, and pondered his own before replying:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder what kind of children we&#39;d have
been if we&#39;d had some other father. Or some
other <i>mother</i>,&quot; he added with a change of tone
as he uttered that last word; and he looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
askance at his sister to see whether she would
glance at him.</p>

<p class="indent">She kept her face set straight forward; but
she impatiently exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Others, others, others! You are always
thinking of <i>others</i>, Herbert!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am one of them myself! I am one of the
others myself!&quot; cried the boy, relieved that his
secret was his own; and bounding suddenly
on the earth also as if with a sense of his kinship
to its unseen host.</p>

<p class="indent">The question he had asked marked him: for
he was one of the children who from the outset
begin to ask of life what it means and who are
surprised when there is no one to tell them.
For him there was no rest until he solved some
mystery or had at least found out where some
mystery stood abandoned on the road&mdash;a
mystery still. Her intelligence stopped short
at what she perfectly knew. She saw with
amazing clearness, but she beheld very little.
Hers was that order of intelligence which is
gifted with vision of almost terrifying accuracy&mdash;at
short range: life is a thin painted curtain,
and its depths are the painted curtain&#39;s depths.</p>

<p class="indent">Once they came to a pair of bars which led
into a meadow. The bars were of green timber
and were very heavy. As he strained and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
tugged at them, she waited close behind him,
dancing to the right and to the left so that there
was a sound of mud-crystals being crushed under
her tyrannical little fat feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hurry, hurry, hurry!&quot; she exclaimed with
impatience. &quot;We may run in the cold, but we
must not stand still in the cold;&quot; and she kicked
him on the heels and pummelled him between
the shoulders with her muff.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am doing my best,&quot; he said, laughing
heartily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your best is not good enough,&quot; she urged,
laughing heartily likewise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This bar is wedged tight. It&#39;s the sap that&#39;s
frozen to the post. Look out there behind!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He stepped back, and, with a short run, lifted
his leg and kicked the bar with his full strength.
The recoil threw him backward to the ground,
but he was quickly on his feet again; and as the
bar was now loosened, he let it down for her.
She stepped serenely through and without looking
back or waiting trotted on. He put the
bars up and with a spurt soon overtook her, for
the meadow they were now crossing had been
closely grazed in the autumn and there was
better walking. They went up rising ground
and reached one of those dome-like elevations
which are a feature of the blue-grass country.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
Straight ahead of them half a mile away stood
the house toward which they were hastening;
a two-story brick house, lifted a little above its
surroundings of yard and gardens and shrubbery
and vines: an oak-tree over its roof, cedar-trees
near its windows, ivy covering one of its
walls, a lawn sloping from it to a thicket of
evergreens where its Christmas Tree each year
was cut.</p>

<p class="indent">The children greeted with fresh enthusiasm
the sight of this charming, this ideal place to
which they were transferring their Christmas
plans and pleasures&mdash;abandoning their own
hearthstone. There lived their father&#39;s friend;
there lived Harold and Elizabeth, their friends;
and there lived the wife and mother of the
household&mdash;the woman toward whom from
their infancy they had been herded as by a
driving hand.</p>

<p class="indent">The tell-tale Christmas smoke of the land
was pouring from its chimneys, showing that
it was being warmed through and through for
coming guests and coming festivities. At one
end of the building, in an ell, was the kitchen;
it sent forth a volume of smoke, the hospitable
invitations of which there was no misunderstanding.
At the opposite end was the parlor:
it stood for the Spirit, as the kitchen for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
the honest Flesh: the wee travellers on the
distant hilltop thought of the flesh first.</p>

<p class="indent">They had no idea of the origin of the American
Christmas. They did not know that this vast
rolling festival has migrated to the New World,
drawing with it things gathered from many
lands and centuries; that the cooking and the
feasting crossed from pagan England; that
the evergreen with its lights and gifts came
from pagan Germany; that the mystical fireside
with its stockings was introduced from
Holland; that the evergreen now awaiting them
in the shut and darkened parlor of this Kentucky
farm-house represented the sacred Tree
which has been found in nearly every ancient
land and is older than the Tree of Life in the
literature of Eden.</p>

<p class="indent">As far as they thought of the antiquity of
the Christmas festival at all, it had descended
straight from the Holy Land and the Manger
of Bethlehem; this error now led to complications.</p>

<p class="indent">The boy&#39;s crimson skull-cap had a peak which
curled forward; and attached to this peak by
several inches of crewel hung a round crimson
ball about the size of the seed-ball of a sycamore.
The shifting wind blew it hither and
thither so that it buffeted him in the face and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
eyes. On this exposed height, especially, the
wind raced free; and he ducked his head and
turned his face sidewise toward her&mdash;an imp
of winter joy&mdash;as he shouted across the gale:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If people are still baking such quantities of
cake in memory of Christmas after all these
hundreds of years, don&#39;t you suppose, Elsie,
that the Apostles must have been fearful cake-eaters?
To have left such an impression on
the world! Cake <i>is</i> a kind of sacred thing at
home even yet, isn&#39;t it? A fine cake looks
still as if it was baked for an Apostle! Doesn&#39;t
it? Now doesn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie did not reply at once. Her younger
brother was growing into the habit of saying
unexpected things. Once after he had left the
breakfast table, she had heard her father say
to her mother that he had genius. Elsie was
not positive as to all that genius comprised;
but she at once decided that if she did not
possess genius she did not wish genius. However
she packed herself off to her room and
thought further about this unpleasant parental
discrimination.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If he has genius,&quot; she said finally, &quot;at least
he did not get it from <i>them</i>,&quot; and there was a
triumph in her eye. &quot;I see not the slightest
sign of genius in either of <i>them:</i> he must have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
gotten it from our grandparents&mdash;never from
<i>them</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">From that moment she had begun to oppose her
mind to his mind as a superior working instrument
in a practical world. Whenever he put
forth a fancy, she put forth a fact; and the fact
was meant to extinguish the fancy as a muffler
puts out a candle. After a moment she now replied&mdash;with
a mind that had repudiated genius:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing is said in the New Testament, my
child, about cake. The only thing mentioned
is loaves and fishes. But they <i>do</i> seem to have
done an unconscionable amount of dining on
bread and fish!&quot; and Elsie had her own satirical
laugh at the table customs of ancient Palestine
as viewed from the Kentucky standard of the
nineteenth century.</p>

<p class="indent">The boy before replying deliberated as always.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They may not have had cake, but they had
meat: because they said he sat with sinners at
meat. I wonder why it was always <i>the sinners</i>
who got <i>the meat</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie could offer no personal objection to this:
Providence had ordained her to dwell in the tents
of flesh herself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How could they feed five thousand people
on five loaves and two fishes? How <i>could</i> they?
At one of those fish dinners!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
&quot;They did it!&quot; said Elsie flatly. She saw
the whole transaction with brilliant clearness&mdash;saw
to the depths of the painted curtain.
It was as naturally fact as the family four of
them at breakfast that morning, fed on home-smoked
sausages and perfectly digestible buckwheat
cakes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And twelve baskets of crumbs! That
makes it worse! With bread for thousands
everywhere, why pick up crumbs?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing is said about crumbs; they were
fragments.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But if I&#39;ve got to believe it, I&#39;ve got to think
how they did it! I&#39;ve <i>got</i> to! If I can&#39;t think
of it as it is, I must think of it as it isn&#39;t! But
I can&#39;t do anything with the loaves; I give up
the bread. However, I think those two fish
might have been leviathans. That would be
only two thousand five hundred people to each
leviathan. Many of them might not have
liked leviathan. I wouldn&#39;t have wanted any!
They could have skipped me! They could have
had my slice! And the babies&mdash;they didn&#39;t
want <i>much</i>! Anyhow, that&#39;s the best I can do
for the fish&quot;; and he had his laugh also&mdash;not
an incessant ripple like hers, but a music issuing
from the depths of him through joy in the
things he saw.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
Elsie made the reply which of late was becoming
habitual in her talks with him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t begin to be <i>peculiar</i>, Herbert. You
are too young to be <i>peculiar</i>. Leave that to
old people!&quot; and Elsie&#39;s mind glided off from
the loaves and the fishes of Galilee to certain
old people of her neighborhood from whose eccentricities
she extracted acrid amusement.</p>

<p class="indent">The boy&#39;s words were not irreverent; irreverence
had never been taught him; he did not
know what irreverence was. They merely expressed
the primary action of his mind in dealing
with what to him was a wonder-story of Nature.
And yet with this same mind which asked
of wonder that it be reasonable, he was on his
way to the celebration of Christmas Eve and to
the story of the Nativity&mdash;the most joyous,
the most sad, the most sublime Nature-story of
mankind.</p>

<p class="indent">His unconscious requirement was that this
also must be reasonable; if it were not, he would
accept the portions that were reasonable and
reject the others as now too childish for his fore-handed
American brain.</p>

<p class="indent">They were nearing the end of their bitter
walk. The little girl as she hurried forward
now and then strained her eyes toward the
opposite ends of the house ahead; at the kitchen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
smoke which promised such gifts to the flesh;
at the window-shutters of the darkened parlor
where the Christmas Tree stood, soon to be
decorated with presents: some for her&mdash;the
little fat mercenary now approaching who was
positive that during these days of preparation
she had struck a shrewd bargain with
the Immortal.</p>

<p class="indent">The boy, too, looked at these windows; but
especially he looked at another between them,
from which perhaps Elizabeth was watching for
him.</p>

<p class="indent">Once he turned, and, walking backward,
directed his gaze from this high point far across
the country. Somewhere back there his father
might now be stopping at a farm-house. A
malignant disease was raging among the children
of the neighborhood, some of whom were his
schoolmates and friends; the holidays would
bring no merry Christmas for them.</p>

<p class="indent">Wherever his father might be, there an influence
started and came rushing across the landscape
like the shadow of a cloud. It fell upon
him, and travelled on toward the house he was
approaching; it disappeared within the house
and fell upon the woman who so wonderfully
moved about in it: a chilling mysterious shadow
that bound the three of them&mdash;his father and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
himself and this gentle woman&mdash;together in a
band of darkness.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he faced about and ran on, longing the
more ardently for Elizabeth: the path between
him and Elizabeth lay before his nimble feet
like a band of light.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p class="h2">WHEN A BOY FINDS OUT ABOUT HIS FATHER</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">On</span> the day preceding that twenty-fourth of
December when his two weather-proof untrammelled
children were rioting over the frozen earth,
Dr. Birney met with an event which may here be
set down as casting the first direct light upon
him. Some reflected radiance may already
have gone glancing in his direction from the
luminous prattle of his offspring; some obscure
glimpses must therein have bodied him forth:
and the portraits that children unconsciously
paint of people&mdash;what trained hand ever drew
such living lines?</p>

<p class="indent">A short stretch across the country from his
comfortable manor house there towered in
stateliness one of the finest homesteads of this
region; and in the great bedroom of this house,
in the mother&#39;s bed, there had lain for days
one of his patients critically ill, the only child
of an intense mother who was herself no longer
young.</p>

<p class="indent">Early that morning upon setting out he had
driven rapidly to this house, gotten quickly out,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
and been quickly received through the front
door thrown open to admit him. After examining
the child, he had turned to the mother and
spoken the words that are probably the happiest
ever to fall from any tongue upon any ear:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is out of danger. He is getting well.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At this intelligence the mother forgot the
presence of another mother older than herself
who had come to be with her during these vigils
and anxieties. As the doctor, having spoken
a few words to the nurse, passed out into the
hall toward the hat-rack, she led him into the
parlors; she pulled him down into a chair beside
the one she took; she caught his hand in hers
and drew it into her lap. She forgot that after
all she was a woman and he was a man; she
remembered only that she was a mother and he
a physician; and unnerved by the relief from
days and nights of tension, she poured out her
quivering gratitude.</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor with a warm light in his eyes
listened; and he was flushed with pleasure also
at his skill in bringing his case through; but
she had scarcely begun before his expression
showed embarrassment. Gratitude rendered
him ill at ease: who can thank Science? Who
can thank a man for doing his duty and his best?
With a smile of deprecation he interrupted:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
&quot;A great surgeon of France centuries ago
was accustomed to say of a convalescent patient:
&#39;God cured him; I dressed him.&#39; I do
not know whether, if I dared speak for the science
of medicine near the close of the nineteenth century,
I could say that. That is not the language
of science now. If science thanks anything, it
thanks other sciences and respects itself. But
I will say that I might not have been able to
save the life of your son if he had not been a
healthy child&mdash;and a happy one; for happiness
in a child is of course one of its signs of health.
In his case I did not have to treat a patient with
a disease; I had merely to treat a disease in a
patient: and there is a great difference. The
patient kept out of the case altogether, or in so
far as he entered it, he entered it as my assistant.
But if he had not been healthy and
happy, the result might have been&mdash;well,
different.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The mother&#39;s face became more radiant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If his health and happiness helped him
through,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;then his mother
enters into the case; for his health was his
birthright from his parents; and his happiness&mdash;on
account of the absence of his father during
most of his life when he has been awake&mdash;has
been a gift from his mother. He has lived with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
Happiness; Happiness has been before his
eyes; Happiness has filled his ears; Happiness
has held him in its arms; Happiness has danced
for his feet; Happiness has rocked him to sleep;
Happiness has smiled over him when he awoke.
He has not known anything but Happiness
because Happiness has been his mother. And
so, if he owes the preservation of his life to Happiness,
he owes it to the instinct of maternal
imitation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor had heard this carolling of maternity
with full approval&mdash;this heaven-rising
skylark song of motherhood; but at the last
sentence he pricked up his ears with disfavor
and stopped smiling: with him these were
marks that he had withdrawn his intellectual
fellowship. The trouble was that he esteemed
her a charming and irreproachable woman and
wife and mother; but that he could accord her
no rank as a scientist, no standing whatsoever;
and therefore he must part company with her
when she spoke for instincts. The instinct of
maternal imitation&mdash;the vanity of it! That
her sex could believe a child to be sent into this
world by the great Mother of all wisdom and
given so poor a start as to be placed under the
tyranny of an instinct to imitate any other
imperfect human being&mdash;man or woman.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
Perhaps it was one of his weaknesses, when
he came upon a case of folly, to wish to perform
an operation in mental surgery at once&mdash;and
without anæsthetics, in order that the wide-awake
intelligence of the sufferer might be enlisted
against the recurrence of such a necessity.</p>

<p class="indent">In a tone of affectionate forbearance he now
said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If only there were any such thing in Nature
as the instinct of maternal imitation! Children
have enough instincts to battle with and fight
their way through, as it is. Let me beg of you
not to teach your child anything as criminally
wrong as that; and don&#39;t you be so criminally
wrong as to believe it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The mother&#39;s countenance fell. She released
the doctor&#39;s hand and pushed her chair back;
and she brushed out her lap with both hands as
though his words might somehow have fallen
into it, and she did not wish them to remain
there. She spoke caustically:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No intimate sacred bond between mother
and child which guides it to imitate her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She felt as though he had attacked the very
citadel of motherhood; as though he had overthrown
the tested and adopted standards of
universal thinking, the very basic idea of existence;
and she recoiled from this as a taint of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
eccentricity in him&mdash;that early death-knell
of a physician&#39;s usefulness.</p>

<p class="indent">But the doctor swept her words away with
gay warmth:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, there is the intimate sacred bond, of
course! No doubt the most intimate, the most
sacred in this world. Believe in that all you
can: the more the better! But we are not
speaking of that: that has nothing to do with
this imagined instinct of maternal imitation.
Don&#39;t you know that a foundling in a foundling
asylum as instinctively imitates its nurse?
Don&#39;t you know that a child as instinctively
imitates its stepmother&mdash;if it loves her?
Don&#39;t you know that a child as instinctively
imitates its grandmother?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The mother lay back in her chair and looked
at him without a word. But then, Doctor
Birney could be rude, curt, brutal. In proof
of which he now leaned over toward her and
continued with more gentleness:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you not know that every child in this
world begins its advance into life by one path
only&mdash;the path of least resistance? and its
path of least resistance is paved and lined with
what it likes! As soon as it can do anything
for itself, it tries to do what it likes, and it never
tries to do anything else. When, later on, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
time comes when it can be persuaded to do a
thing that it has already desired <i>not</i> to do, then
its will comes into the case; it ceases to be
simply a little animal and becomes a little
human animal; it begins to be moral and
heroic instead of unmoral and unheroic. But
we are not talking about that. The best we
can do is to call those earliest movements of
its life the reaching out of its instincts and its
taking hold of things that are like its own
leading traits. The parallel is in Nature where
the tendril of a vine takes hold of the matured
branch of the same vine and pulls itself up by
this. Thus one generation knits itself to
another through the binding of like to like;
and that is the whole bond between mother and
child or father and child: it is like attaching
itself to like under the influence of love. In
this world every subject has two doors: you
open one, and the good things come out. You
open the other, and the evil things come out.
This subject has its two doors: and I open
first the door of Mother of Pearl&mdash;for you
two pearls of mothers! Out of it come all the
exquisite radiant traits that bind mothers and
children. How many great men in history
have begun their growth by attaching themselves
to the great traits of their mothers?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
Then there is the other door. I am sorry to
open it, but whether I open it or not, opened
it will be: the Door of Ebony behind which
are imprisoned all the dark things that bind
parents and children. I am afraid I shall have
to illustrate: if a child is born mendacious and
its mother has mendacity as one of her leading
traits, its little mendacity will flourish on her
large mendacity. If it is born deceitful, and
hypocrisy is one of her traits, hypocrisy in it
will pull itself up by taking hold of hypocrisy
in her. If it is born quick-tempered, and if
ungovernable temper is one of her failings,
every exhibition of this in her will foster its
impatience and lack of self-control. These
are some few of the dreadful things that come
out: and if it is dreadful even to speak of them,
think how much more dreadful to see them alive
and to set them at work! Now let&#39;s shut the dark
Door! And let us hope that some day Nature
herself may not be able to open it ever again!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hitherto the older of the two mothers, the
mother of many children, had remained silent
with that peculiar expression of patience and
sweetness which lies like a halo on the faces of
good women who have brought many children
into the world. She now spoke as if to release
many thoughts weighing heavily upon her.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
&quot;It has always been my trouble&mdash;not that
my children would not imitate me, but that
they <i>would</i> imitate me! I have my faults, for
I am human; and I can endure them as long
as they remain mine. They have ceased to give
me much concern. I suppose in a way I have
grown attached to them, just as I like people
whom I do not entirely approve. But as soon
as I see the children reproducing my faults, these
become responsibilities. They keep me awake
at night; sometimes they distress me almost
beyond endurance. I know I have spent many
anxious years with this problem. And I know
also that the only times when their father has
been overanxious about his failings has been
when the boys have imitated <i>him</i>. He is always
ready to lead a splendid attack on his faults,
and they march at him from the direction of
the boys!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And so,&quot; said the doctor, laughing, &quot;this
instinct of parental imitation is an instrument
safe to take by the handle, and dangerous to
grasp by the blade!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He knew fathers in the neighborhood who
were dreading the time when their sons might
begin to imitate them&mdash;too far. And other
fathers dreading the hour when their sons
might cease to imitate their sires, and wander
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
away preferably to imitate persons outside the
family connection,&mdash;possibly an instinct of
non-parental imitation!</p>

<p class="indent">He rose to go in a mood of great good nature,
and looked from one to the other of the two
mothers:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps Nature protected children from the
danger of imitating by not making it their
duty to imitate. And perhaps, as all parents
are imperfect human beings, she may have
thought it simple justice to children to confer
upon them the right to be disobedient. At
least, if there is an instinct to obey, it is backed
up with an equal instinct not to obey; and the
two seem to have been left to fight it out
between themselves; and that perhaps is the
great battle-field where incessant fighting goes
on between parents and children. And at least
disobedience has been of equal value with obedience
in the making of human history, in the
development of the race. For if children had
simply obeyed their parents, if the young had
been born merely to ape the old, there never
would have been any human young and old.
We should all still be apes, even if we had
developed as far as that. You two ladies&mdash;of
course with greatly modified features&mdash;might
be throwing cocoanuts at each other on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
the tops of two rival palm-trees. Or&mdash;as the dutiful
daughters of dutiful mothers&mdash;you might be
taking afternoon naps in an oasis of dates&mdash;all
because of that instinct of maternal imitation!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He hurried out to the hat-rack, making his
retreat at the top of his own high spirits, they
following; and with one glove on he held out his
hand to the mother of the sick boy:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll come in the morning to see how he is&mdash;and
to see how his mother is. Now shake hands and
say I have been a good doctor to you both.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The mother&#39;s reply showed that bitterness
rankled in her, as she yielded her hand coldly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Even if you have tried to destroy for me the
intimate sacred bond between a mother and her
child, I don&#39;t think you will be able to deny that my
boy is a healthy and happy child because he is a
child of a perfect marriage!&quot; And she looked
with secret and shaded import at the other mother.</p>

<p class="indent">As the doctor drove out of the yard her last
words lingered&mdash;<i>the healthy children of a perfect
marriage</i>. And the look the two mothers
had exchanged! It was as though each had a
sword in her eye and touched him with the
point of it&mdash;hinting that he merited being run
through. How often during these years he had
encountered that same look from other mothers
of the neighborhood!</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
&quot;But if a wound like that could have been
fatal,&quot; he reflected, &quot;if a wound like that could
have finished me, I should not have been here
to save the life of her boy; he would have been
dead this morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then his mind under the rigor of long training
passed to happier subjects. His success in the
case of this child was one more triumph in his long
list; it renewed his grip on power within him.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">But for the necessity to provide for a people
the services of general practitioner, Dr. Birney
would have made a specialty of children&#39;s
diseases. The happiest moment he experienced
in his profession was a day such as this when
he could announce the triumph of his skill and
the saving of a young life. There was no
sadder one than any day on which he walked
out of the sick chamber and at the threshold
met the gaunt ancient Presence, waiting to
stalk in and take the final charge of the case
given up by the vanquished physician. And
when a few days later he sat in his buggy on
the turnpike at the end of a procession&mdash;his
healthy little patient stretched prostrate at
the other end&mdash;he driving there as the public
representative of a science that was ages old
and that had gathered from all lands the wisdom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
of the best minds but was still impotent&mdash;on
such a day he went down to his lowest defeat.</p>

<p class="indent">He had such faith in the future of his science
that he looked forward to the time when there
would be no such monstrous tragedy on this
planet as infant mortality. No healthy child
would ever be allowed to die of disease; disease
would never be permitted to reach it, or reaching
it, would be arrested as it arrived. The
vast multitude of physicians and surgeons now
camped around the morning of life, waiting
to receive the incoming generations on the rosy
mountain-tops of its dawn&mdash;nearly all these
would be withdrawn; they would move across
the landscape of the world and pitch their tents
on the plains of waning daylight; there to
receive the ragged and broken army that came
staggering from the battle-field, every soldier
more or less wounded, every soldier more or less
weary; there to give them a twilight of least
suffering, their sundown of peace; and there
to arrange that the great dark Gates closed on
them softly.</p>

<p class="indent">The conversation that morning disclosed
among other facts the secret dread of Dr.
Birney&#39;s life: that the time would come when
his children, especially his boy, might begin to
imitate him more than he desired. For a long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
time now he had kept under closest observation
the working out in each of them of the law
of like attaching itself to like; for already this
had borne fruit for both on the vine of his own
profession.</p>

<p class="indent">A physician in a city may practise his profession
with complete segregation from the members
of his family; his office may be miles away;
if he sees his patients in his house, his children
are kept in another part of it. But out in the
country the whole house is open; the children
rove everywhere; if their father is a physician,
they know when he starts and when he returns;
and there is displayed in full view the entire
drama of his life. And this life is twofold:
for the physician must demonstrate as no
member of any other profession is required to
do&mdash;that whoever would best serve mankind
must first best serve himself. In this service
he must reach a solution of the selfish and the
unselfish; he must reconcile the world&#39;s two
warring philosophies of egoism and altruism.
The outside world has its attention fixed solely
upon the drama of the physician&#39;s public service
to it; for the members of his own family
is reserved acquaintance with the drama of his
devotion to himself. Well for him and well for
them if they do not misunderstand!</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
Each of Dr. Birney&#39;s children responded to
the attraction of a phase of his life&mdash;the phase
that appealed to a leading trait in each.</p>

<p class="indent">From the time of the little girl&#39;s beginning
to observe her father she was influenced by what
looked to her like his self-love: his care about
what he ate and drank; his changing of his
clothes whenever he came home, whether they
were drenched or were dry; his constant washing
of his hands; all this pageant of self-adulation
mirrored itself in her consciousness.
When he was away from home, she could still
follow him by her mother&#39;s solicitude for his
comfort and safety. To Elsie&#39;s mother the ill
were not so much a source of anxiety as a husband
who was perfectly well; and thus there
had been built up in Elsie herself the domineering
idea that her father was the all-important
personage in the neighborhood as a consequence
of thinking chiefly of himself. Selfishness in
her reached out and twined itself like a tendril
about selfishness in him; and she proceeded to
lift herself up and grow by this vital bond.</p>

<p class="indent">Too young to transmit this resemblance, she
did what she could to pass it on to the next
generation: she handed it down and disseminated
it in her doll-house. There was something
terrifying and grim and awful in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
fatalistic accuracy with which Elsie reproduced
her father&#39;s selfishness among her dolls, because
it was on a mimic scale what is going on all over
the world: the weaving by children&#39;s fingers
of parental designs long perpetuated in the
tapestry of Nature; the same old looms, the
same old threads, the same old designs&mdash;but
new fingers.</p>

<p class="indent">One of the dolls was known as &quot;the doctor&quot;;
the others were the members of his family and
his domestics. This puppet was a perfect
child-image of the god of self-idolatry, as set
up in the person of a certain Dr. Downs
Birney, and as observed by his very loyal and
most affectionate and highly amused daughter
Elsie.</p>

<p class="indent">One day the doctor, quietly passing the opened
door of the nursery, saw Elsie on the floor with
her back turned to him faithfully copying and
dramatizing some of the daily scenes of his
professional life. His eyes shone with humor
as he looked on; but there was sadness in them
as he turned silently away.</p>

<p class="indent">With the boy it was otherwise. The earliest
notion of his father the boy had grasped was
that of always travelling toward the sick&mdash;to
a world that needed him. All the roads of
the neighborhood&mdash;turnpikes, lanes, carriage-tracks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
wagon-tracks, foot-paths&mdash;met at his
father&#39;s house; if you followed any one of them
long enough, sooner or later you would reach
some one who was sick.</p>

<p class="indent">When he was quite young his father began
to take him in his buggy on his circuits; and at
every house where they stopped, he witnessed
this never-ending drama of need and aid. Such
countenances people had as they followed his
father out to the buggy where he was holding
the reins! Such happy faces&mdash;or so sad, so
sad! Souls hanging on his father&#39;s word as
though life went on with it or went to pieces
with it. Actually his father had no business
of his own: he merely drove about and enabled
other people to attend to their business! He
one day asked him why he did not <i>sometimes</i>
do something for himself and the family!</p>

<p class="indent">Thus a leading trait in him gripped that
branch of his father&#39;s life where hung his service
to others; and by this vital bond it lifted
itself up and began to flourish in its long travel
toward maturity. He literally took hold of his
father, as a social implement, by the well-worn
handle of common use.</p>

<p class="indent">His presence in the buggy with his father was
not incidental; it was the doctor&#39;s design. He
wished to have the boy along during these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
formative years in order that he might get the
right start toward the great things of life as
these one by one begin to break in upon the
attention of a growing boy. The doctor wanted
to be the first to talk with him&mdash;the first to
sow the right suggestions: it was one of his
sayings that the earliest suggestions rooted in
the mind of the child will be the final things to
drop from the dying man&#39;s brain: what goes in
first comes out last.</p>

<p class="indent">And so there began to be many conversations;
incredible questions; answers not always forthcoming.
And a series of revelations ensued;
the boy revealing his growth to a watchful
father, and a father revealing his life to a very
watchful son! These revelations began to look
like mile-stones on life&#39;s road, marked with
further understandings.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus, one day when the boy was a good deal
younger than now, his father had come home
and had gotten ready to go away again and
was sitting before the fire, looking gravely into
it and taking solitary counsel about some desperate
case, as the country doctor must often
do. Being a very little fellow then, he had
straddled one of his father&#39;s mighty legs and
had balanced himself by resting his hands on
his father&#39;s mighty shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
&quot;Is somebody very sick?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The head under the weather-roughened hat
nodded silently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder how it happens that all the sick
are in our neighborhood.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A smile flitted across the doctor&#39;s mouth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The sick are in all neighborhoods, little
wonderer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He said this cheerfully. It was his idea&mdash;and
he tried to enforce it at home&mdash;that young
children must never, if possible, make the acquaintance
of the words <i>bad</i> and <i>sad</i>&mdash;nor of
the realities that are masked behind them. He
especially believed that what the old are familiar
with as life&#39;s tragic laws ought never to be told
to children as tragic: what is inevitable should
never be presented to them as misfortunes.</p>

<p class="indent">Therefore he now declared that the sick are
in all neighborhoods as he might have stated
that there are wings on all birds, or leaves on all
growing apple trees.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not all over the world?&quot; asked the boy,
enlarging his vision in space.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All over the world,&quot; admitted the doctor
with entire cheerfulness; the fact was a matter
of no consequence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not all the time?&quot; asked the boy, enlarging
his outlook in time.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
&quot;All the time! All over the world and all the
time!&quot; conceded the doctor, as though this made
not the slightest difference to a human being.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Isn&#39;t there a single minute when everybody
is well everywhere?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not a single, solitary minute.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then somebody must always be suffering.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor nodded again; the matter was
not worth speaking of.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then somebody else must always be sorry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor bowed encouragingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Then I am sorry, too!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This time the doctor did not move his head,
and he did not open his lips. He saw that a
new moment had arrived in the boy&#39;s growth&mdash;a
consciousness of the universal tragedy and
personal share and sorrow in it. He knew that
many people never feel this; some feel it late; a
few feel it early; he had always said that children
should never feel it. He knew also that when
once it has begun, it never ends. Nothing ever
banishes it or stills it&mdash;that perception of the
human tragedy and one&#39;s share and sorrow in it.</p>

<p class="indent">He did not welcome its appearance now, in
his son least of all. For an instant he charged
himself with having made a mistake in taking
the child along on his visits to the sick, thus
making known too early the dark side of happy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
neighborhood life. Then he went further back
and traced this premature seriousness to its
home and its beginning: in prenatal depression&mdash;in
a mother&#39;s anguish and a wife&#39;s despair.
It was a bitter retrospect: it kept him brooding.</p>

<p class="indent">The chatter was persistent. A hand was
stretched up, and it took hold of his chin and
shook it:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There ought to be a country where nobody
suffers and there ought to be a time; a large
country and a long time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is such a country and there is such a
time, Herbert,&quot; said the doctor, now with some
sadness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I&#39;ll warrant you it&#39;s part of the
United States,&quot; cried the boy, getting his idea
of mortality slightly mixed with his early Americanism.
&quot;Texas would hold them, wouldn&#39;t
it? Don&#39;t you think Texas could contain
them all and contain them forever?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor laughed and seemed to think
enough had been said on the subject of large
enough graveyards for the race.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why don&#39;t you doctors send your patients
to that country?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps we do sometimes!&quot; The doctor
laughed again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you ever send yours?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
&quot;Possibly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And how many do <i>you</i> send?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know!&quot; exclaimed the doctor,
laughing this time without being wholly amused.
&quot;I don&#39;t know, and I never intend to try to find
out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When I grow up we&#39;ll practise together and
send twice as many,&quot; the boy said, looking into
his father&#39;s eyes with the flattery of professional
imitation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So we will! There&#39;ll be no trouble about
that! Twice as many, perhaps three times!
No trouble whatever!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He took the hands from his shoulders and
laid them in the palm of his and studied them&mdash;those
masculine boyish hands that had never
touched any of the world&#39;s suffering. And
then he looked at his own hands which had
handled so much of the world&#39;s suffering, but
had never reached happiness; happiness which
for years had dwelt just at his finger-tips but
beyond arm&#39;s reach.</p>

<p class="indent">Not very long afterwards another conversation
lettered another mile-stone in the
progress of mutual understanding.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a beautiful drowsy May morning near
noon, and the two were driving slowly homeward
along the turnpike. When the lazily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
trotting horse reached the front gate of a certain
homestead, he stopped and threw one ear
backward as a living interrogation point. As
his answer, he got an unexpected cut in the
flank with the tip of the lash that was like the
sting of a hornet: a reminder that the driver
was not alone in the buggy; that the horse
should have known he was not alone; and that
what he did when alone was a matter of confidence
between master and beast.</p>

<p class="indent">The boy, who had been thrown backward,
heels high, laughed as he settled himself again
on his cushion:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He thought you wanted to turn in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He thinks too much&mdash;sometimes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t they ever get sick there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose they do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Then</i> you turn in!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I <i>don&#39;t</i> turn in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aren&#39;t you their doctor?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was the doctor once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where was I?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know where you were; you were
not born.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So many things happened before I was
born; I wish they hadn&#39;t!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a pity; I had the same experience.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The buggy rolled slowly along homeward.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
On one side of the road were fields of young
Indian corn, the swordlike blades flashing in
the sun; on the other side fields of red clover
blooming; the fragrance was wafted over the
fence to the buggy. Further, in a soft grassy
lawn, on a little knoll shaded by a white
ash, a group of sleek cattle stood content
in their blameless world. Over the prostrate
cows one lordly head, its incurved horns deep
hidden by its curls, kept guard. The scene
was a living Kentucky replica of Paul Potter&#39;s
<i>Bull</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Drive!&quot; murmured the doctor, handing
over the reins; and he drew his hat low over
his eyes and set his shoulder against his corner
of the buggy; he often caught up with sleep
while on the road. And he often tried to catch
up with thinking.</p>

<p class="indent">The horse always knew when the reins
changed hands. He disregarded the proxy,
kept his own gait, picked the best of the road,
and turned out for passing vehicles. The boy
now grasped the lines with unexpected positiveness;
and he leaned over and looked up under
the rim of his father&#39;s hat:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope the doctor they employ will give
them the wrong medicines,&quot; he confided. &quot;I
hope the last one of them will have many a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
rattling good bellyache for their meanness to
you!&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Then more years for father and son, each
finding the other out.</p>

<p class="indent">And now finally on the morning of that
twenty-fourth day of December, the father was
to witness a scene in the drama of his life as
amazingly performed by his son&mdash;illustrating
what a little actor can do when he undertakes to
imitate an old actor to whom he is most loyal.</p>

<p class="indent">That morning after breakfast the apt pupil
in Life&#39;s School had been sent for, and when
he had entered the library, his father was
sitting before the fire, idle. The buggy was
not waiting outside; the hat and overcoat and
gloves were nowhere in sight; and he had not
gotten ready his satchel which took the place
of the saddlebags of earlier generations when
the country doctor travelled around on horseback
and carried the honey of physic packed at
his thighs&mdash;like a wingless, befattened bumblebee.
This morning it looked as though all the
sick were well at last; it was a sound if wicked
world; and nothing was left for a physician
but to be happy in it&mdash;without a profession&mdash;and
without wickedness.</p>

<p class="indent">He threw himself into his father&#39;s impulsively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
opened arms, and was heaved high into
his lap. Though he was growing rather mature
for laps now; he was beginning to speculate
about having something of a lap of his own;
quite a good deal of a lap.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How is the children&#39;s epidemic to-day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never you mind about the children&#39;s epidemic!
I&#39;ll take care of the children&#39;s epidemic,&quot;
repeated the doctor, pulling the long-faced,
autumn-faced prodigy of all questions
between his knees and looking him over with
secret solicitude. &quot;We&#39;ll not talk about sick
children, but about two well children&mdash;thanked
be the Father of all children! So you and
Elsie are going away to help celebrate a Christmas
Tree.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; but when are you going to have a
Christmas Tree of our own?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now, that subject had two prongs, and the
doctor seized the prong that did not pierce
family affairs&mdash;did not pierce <i>him</i>. He settled
down to the subject with splendid warmth and
heartiness:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, let me see! You may have your
first Christmas Tree as soon as you are old
enough to commence to do things for other
people; as soon as you can receive into your
head the smallest hard pill of an idea about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
your duty to millions and millions and millions
of your fellow medicine takers. Can you understand
that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gracious! That would be a <i>big</i> pill&mdash;larger
than my head! I don&#39;t see what it has
to do with one miserable little dead pine tree!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor roared.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It has this to do with one miserable dead
pine tree: don&#39;t you know yet that Christmas
Trees are in memory of a boy who was once
exactly your age and height&mdash;and perhaps
with your appetite&mdash;and with just as many
eyes and possibly even more questions? The
boy grew up to be a man. The man became a
teacher. The teacher became a neighborhood
doctor. The neighborhood doctor became the
greatest physician of the world&mdash;and he never
took a fee!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, yes! But he wasn&#39;t a better doctor
than <i>you</i> are, was he? If he&#39;d come into this
neighborhood and tried to practise, you&#39;d soon
have ousted him, wouldn&#39;t you, with your doses
and soups and jellies?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Humph!&quot; grunted the doctor with a wry
twist of the mouth; &quot;I suppose I would!
Yes; undoubtedly I&#39;d have ousted him! He
could never have competed with me in <i>my</i>
practice; never! But we won&#39;t try that hard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
little pill of an idea any more. We&#39;ll drop the
subject of Christmas Trees for one more year.
Perhaps by that time you can take the pill as
a powder! So! I hear you are going to attend
a dancing party; we&#39;ll talk about the party.
And you are going over there to stay all night.
I wish I were going. I wish I were going over
there to stay all night,&quot; reiterated the man,
with an outrush of solemn tenderness that
reached back through vain years, through so
many parched, unfilled years.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish so, too,&quot; cried the boy, instantly
burying his face on his father&#39;s coat-sleeve,
then lifting it again and looking at him with a
guilty flush which the doctor did not observe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, do you! We won&#39;t say anything more
about that, though I&#39;m glad you&#39;d like to have
me along. Now then; go and have a good
time! And take long steps and large mouthfuls!
And you might do well to remember
that a boy&#39;s stomach is not a birdnest to be
lined with candy eggs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think candy eggs would make a very good
lining, better than real eggs; and about half
the time you&#39;re trying to line me with them,
aren&#39;t you? With all the sulphur in them!
And I do hate sulphur, and I have always hated
it since the boy at my desk in school wore a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
bag of it around his neck under his shirt to
keep off diseases. My! how he smelt&mdash;worse
than contagion! Candy eggs would make a
very good lining; even the regular soldiers get
candy in their rations now. And they don&#39;t
have to eat new-laid eggs of mornings! Think
of an army having to win a hard-fought battle
on soft-boiled eggs! They don&#39;t have to do
<i>that</i>, do they?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They do not!&quot; said the doctor. &quot;They
positively do not! But we won&#39;t say anything
more about eggs&mdash;saccharine or sulphurous.
What are you going to do at the party?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am going to dance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Alone? O dear! All alone? You&#39;d better
go skate on the ice! Not all alone?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should say not! With my girl, of course.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s better, much better. And then
what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am going to promenade, with my girl on
my arm.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On <i>both</i> arms, did you say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; on <i>one</i> arm.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Which?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Either.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That sounds natural! (Heart action regular;
brain unclouded; temperature normal.)
And then? What next?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
&quot;I&#39;m going to take the darling in to supper.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hold on! Not so fast! Suppose there
isn&#39;t any supper&mdash;for the darling.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t say that! It would nearly kill me!
Don&#39;t you suppose there&#39;ll be any supper?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m afraid there will be. Well, after the
darling has had her fatal supper? (Of course
you won&#39;t want any!) What then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What else is there to do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t look as innocent as you imagine!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t have to confess what you&#39;d like
to do, do you? Would you have told your
father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think I would.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I won&#39;t tell you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you needn&#39;t! I don&#39;t wish to know&mdash;only
it must <i>not</i> be on the cheek! Remember,
you are no son of mine if it&#39;s on the cheek!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought I heard you say <i>that</i> got people
into trouble.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Maybe I did. I ought to have said it if I
didn&#39;t; and it seems to be the kind of trouble
that you are trying to get into. (Temperature
rising but still normal. Respiration deeper.
All symptoms favorable. No further bulletins
deemed necessary.) Well, then? Where were
we?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anyhow, I&#39;ve never thought of cheeks when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
I&#39;ve thought of <i>that</i>; I thought cheeks were for
chewing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Guardian Powers of our erring reason!
Where did you get that idea&mdash;if sanity can
call it an idea?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Watching our cows.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor laughed till tears ran down his
face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can&#39;t learn much about kissing by
watching anybody&#39;s <i>cows</i>, Governor,&quot; he said,
wiping the tears away. &quot;Not about <i>human</i>
kissing. You must begin to direct your attention
to an animal not so meek and drivable.
You must learn to consider, my son, that hornless
wonder and terror of the world who forever
grazes but never ruminates!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For years, in talking with a mind too young
wholly to understand, he had enjoyed the play
of his own mind. He knew only too well that
there are few or none with whom a physician
may dare have his sportive fling at his fellow-creatures,
at life in general. From a listener
who never sat in harsh judgment and who
would never miscarry his random words, he
had upon occasion derived incalculable relief.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anyhow, I have learned that cows have
the new American way of chewing; so they
never get indigestion, do they?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
&quot;If they do, they cannot voice their symptoms
in my mummied ears,&quot; said the doctor,
who often seemed to himself to have been
listening to hue and cry for medicine since the
days of Thotmes. &quot;However, we won&#39;t say
anything further about <i>that</i>! What else are
you going to do over there? This can&#39;t possibly
be all!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To-night we children are going to sit up
until midnight, to see whether the animals
bellow and roar and make all kinds of noise
on Christmas Eve. We know they don&#39;t, but
we&#39;re going to <i>prove</i> they don&#39;t!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where did you pick up that notion?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where did you pick it up when you were a
boy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I fail to remember,&quot; admitted the doctor
with mock dignity, damaged in his logic but
recalling the child legend that on the Night of
the Nativity universal nature was in sympathy
with the miracle. All sentient creatures were
wakeful and stirring, and sent forth the chorus
of their cries in stables and barns&mdash;paying
their tribute to the Divine in the Manger and
proclaiming their brotherhood with Him who
was to bring into the world a new gospel for
them also.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know where I got that,&quot; he repeated.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
&quot;Well, after the animals bellow and roar and
make all kinds of noise, then what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There isn&#39;t but one thing more; but that is
best of all!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t say! Out with it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is our secret.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The new decision of tone demonstrated that
another stage had been reached in their intercourse.
The boy had withdrawn his confidence;
he had entered the ranks of his own generation
and had taken his confidence with him. Personally,
also, he had shut the gate of his mind
and the gate was guarded by a will; henceforth
it was to be opened by permission of the
guard. Something in their lives was abruptly
ended; the father felt like ending the talk.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, then; we won&#39;t say anything
more about the secret. And now you had better
run along.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I don&#39;t want to run along just yet. It
will be a long time before I see you again;
have you thought of that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He reversed his position so as to face the
fire; and he crossed his feet out beyond the
promontory of the doctor&#39;s knees and folded
his arms on the rampart of those enfolding arms.</p>

<p class="indent">For a few moments there was intimate
silence. Then he inquired:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
&quot;How old must a boy be to ask a girl?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A flame more tender and humorous burned
in the doctor&#39;s eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ask her <i>what</i>?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ask her nothing! Ask <i>her</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mean <i>tell</i> her, don&#39;t you? Not ask
her, my friend and relative; <i>tell</i> her!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, ask her and tell her, too; they go
together!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it possible! I&#39;m always glad to learn!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then, how old must he be?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, if you stand in need of the opinion
of an experienced physician, as soon as he
learns to speak would be about the right period!
That would be the safest age! The patient
would then have leisure to consider his case
before being affected by the disease. You
could have time to get singed and step away
gradually instead of being roasted alive all at
once. Does that sound hard?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not very! Do you love a girl longer if
you tell her or if you don&#39;t tell her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m afraid nobody has ever tried <i>both</i> ways!
Suppose you try both, and let us have the benefit
of your experience.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, then, if you love, do you love forever?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor laughed nervously and tightened
his arms around the innocent.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
&quot;Nobody has lived forever yet&mdash;nobody
knows!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But forever while you live&mdash;do you love
as long as that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You wouldn&#39;t know until you were dead
and then it would be too late to report. But
aren&#39;t you doing a good deal of hard fighting
this morning,&mdash;on soft-boiled eggs,&mdash;though I
think the victory is yours, General, the victory
is truly and honestly yours!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t stop thinking, can I? You don&#39;t
expect me to stop thinking, do you, when I&#39;m
just beginning really to think?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, then, we won&#39;t say anything more
about thinking.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then do you or don&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, what are you trying to talk about?&quot;
demanded the doctor angrily, and as if on
instant guard. A new hatred seemed coming
to life in him; there was a burning flash of
it in his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just between ourselves&mdash;suppose that when
I am a man and after I have been married to
Elizabeth awhile, I get tired of her and want a
little change. And I fell in love with another
man&#39;s wife and dared not tell her, because if I
did I might get a bullet through me; would I
love the other man&#39;s wife more because I could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
not tell her, or would I love her more because I
told her and risked the bullet?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pall-like silence draped the room, thick, awful
silence. The father lifted his son from his lap
to the floor, and turned him squarely around
and looked him in the eyes imperiously. Many a
time with some such screened but piercing power
he, as a doctor, had scrutinized the faces of
children to see whether they were aware that
some vast tragedy of life was in the room with
them. To keep them from knowing had often
been his main care; seeing them know had been
life&#39;s last pity; young children finding out the
tragedies of their parents with one another&mdash;so
many kinds of tragedies.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You had better go now,&quot; he urged gently.
Then an idea clamped his brain in its vise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And remember: while you are over there,
you must try to behave with your best manners
because you are going to stay in the house of a
great lady. All the questions that you want
to ask, ask me when you come back. Ask
<i>me</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The boy standing before his father said with
a strange quietness and stubbornness, probing
him deeply through the eyes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You haven&#39;t answered my <i>last</i> question yet,
have you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
&quot;Not yet,&quot; said the doctor, with strange
quietness also.</p>

<p class="indent">The boy had never before heard that tone
from his father.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s sad being a doctor, isn&#39;t it?&quot; he suggested,
studying his father&#39;s expression.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do <i>you</i> know about sad? Who told
<i>you</i> anything about sad?&quot; muttered the doctor
with new sadness now added to old sadness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nobody <i>had</i> to tell me! I knew without
being told.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Run along now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now I&#39;ll walk along, but I won&#39;t run along.
I&#39;ll walk away from you, but I won&#39;t run away
from you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He wandered across the room, and stood with
his hand reluctantly turning the knob. Then
with a long, silent look at his father&mdash;he closed
the door between them.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span></p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p class="h2">THE BOOKS OF THE YEAR</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Dr.</span> Birney stood motionless in the middle of
the room with his gaze riveted on the door
through which his son had lingeringly disappeared.</p>

<p class="indent">Some one of the world&#39;s greatest painters,
chancing to enter, might worthily have desired
to paint him&mdash;putting no questions as to who
the man was or what he was; or what darkening
or brightening history stretched behind him;
or what entanglement of right and wrong lay
around and within: painting only the unmistakable
human signs he witnessed, and leaving
his portrait for thousands of people to look at
afterwards and make out of it what they could&mdash;through
kinship with the good and evil in themselves:
Velasquez, with his brush moving upon
those areas of lonely struggle which sometimes
lie with their wrecks at the bottom of the sea of
human eyes; Franz Hals, fixing the cares which
hover too long around our mouths; Vandyck,
sitting in the shadow of the mystery that slants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
across all mortal shoulders; Rembrandt, drawn
apart into the dignity that invests colossal
disappointment. Any merciless, masterful limner
of them all in a mood to portray those secret
passions which drive men, especially men of
middle age, towards safer deeps upon the rocks.</p>

<p class="indent">He had a well-set soldierly figure and the
swarthy roughened face that results from years
of exposure to weather&mdash;a face looking as if
inwardly scarred by the tempests of his character
but unwrinkled by the outer years. Both
face and figure breathed the silent impassiveness
of the regular who has been through campaigns
enough already but is enlisted for life and for
whatsoever duty may bring; he standing there
in some wise palpably draped in the ideals of his
profession as the soldier keeps his standard
waving high somewhere near his tent, to remind
him of the greatness that he guards and of the
greatness that guards him.</p>

<p class="indent">Not a tall man as men grow on that Kentucky
plateau; and looking less than his stature
by reason of being so strongly built, square-standing,
ponderous; his muscles here and there
perceivable under his loosely fitting sack-suit
of dark-gray tweeds; so that out of respect for
strength which is both manhood and manliness,
your eye travelled approvingly over his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
proportions: measuring the heavy legs down
to the boots; the heavy arms out to the wrists;
the heavy square thick muscular warm hands;
and the heavy torso up to the short neck rising
full out of a low turned-down collar.</p>

<p class="indent">In this neck an animal wildness and virile
ferocity&mdash;not subdued, not stamped out, partly
tamed by a will. Overtopping this neck a
tremendous head covered with short glossy
black hair, curling blue-black hair. In this
head a powerful blunt nose, set like the muzzle
of a big gun pointed to fire a heavy projectile at
a distant target&mdash;the nose of a never-releasing
tenacity. Above this nose, right and left, thick
black brows, the bars of nature&#39;s iron purpose.
Under these brows wonderful grayish eyes with
glints of Scotch blue in them or of Irish blue or
of Saxon blue; for the blood of three races ran
thick in his veins and mingled in the confusions
of his character: blue that was in the eyes of
earlier Scottish men, exulting in heather and
highland stag; or the blue of other eyes that had
looked meltingly on golden-haired minstrel and
gold-framed harp&mdash;eyes that might have poured
their love into Isolde&#39;s or have faded out in the
death of Tristan; or the blue of still other eyes&mdash;archers
who had shot their last arrows and,
dying, drew themselves to the feet of Harold,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
their blue-eyed king fighting for Saxon England&#39;s
right and might.</p>

<p class="indent">They were eyes that could look you to the core
with intelligence and then rest upon you from
the outside with sympathy for all that he had
seen to be human in you whether of strength or
of weakness&mdash;but never of meanness. Under
the blunt nose a thick stubby mustache trimmed
short, leaving exposed the whole red mouth&mdash;the
mouth of great passions&mdash;no paltry passions&mdash;none
despicable or contemptible.</p>

<p class="indent">On the whole a man who advances upon you
with all there is in him and without waiting for
you to advance upon him; no stepping aside for
people in this world by this man, nor stepping
timidly over things. Even as he stood there a
motionless figure, he diffused an influence most
warm and human, gay and tragic, irresistible.
A man loved secretly or openly by many women.
A man that men were glad to come to confide in,
when they crossed the frontiers of what Balzac,
speaking of the soldiers of Napoleon, called their
miserable joys and joyous miseries.</p>

<p class="indent">But assuredly not a man to be put together
by piecemeal description such as this:
the very secret of his immense influence being
some charm of mystery, as there is mystery
in all the people that win us and rule us and hold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
us; as though we pressed our ear against this
mystery and caught there the sound of a meaning
vaster than ourselves&mdash;not meant for us
but flowing away from us along the unbroken
channels of the universe: still to be flowing
there long after we ourselves are stilled.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Thus he stood in his library that morning
when his son left him, brought to a stop in the
road of life as by a straw fallen at his feet borne
on a rising wind&mdash;another harbinger of a coming
storm.</p>

<p class="indent">By and by not far away a door on that side of
the house was slammed. The sound of muffled
feet was heard on the porch and then the laughter
of children as they bounded across the yard.
As his ear caught the noises, he hurried to the
window and looked out; and then he threw up
the sash and hailed them loudly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ho, there! you winter snow-birds without
wings!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As the children wheeled and paused, he smiled
and shook his forefinger:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Remember to keep those two red mouths
closed and to breathe through those two red
noses!&quot; and then as he recalled some exercises
which he had lately been putting them through, he
added with ironic emphasis, laughing the while:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
&quot;And when you breathe, remember to bring
into play those two invaluable little American
diaphragms and those two priceless pairs of
American ribs!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The little girl nodded repeatedly to indicate
that she could understand if she would and
would obey if she cared; and putting her red-mittened
finger-tips to her lips, she threw him
a good-by with a wide sweeping gesture of the
arms to right and left. And the boy made a
soldierly salute, touching a hand to his skull-cap
with the uncouth rigor of a veteran in the raw:
then they bounded off again.</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor drew down the sash and watched
them.</p>

<p class="indent">A hundred yards from the house the ground
sloped to a limestone spring at the foot of
the hill&mdash;a characteristic Kentucky formation.
From this spring issued a brook, on the banks
of which stood a clump of forest trees, bathing
their roots in the moisture. Upon reaching the
brow of this hill, the boy lagged behind his sister
as though to elude her observation; then turning
looked back at his father&mdash;looked but made
no sign: a little upright pillar of life on the brow
of that declivity: then he dropped out of sight.</p>

<p class="indent">A few moments later up over the hill where
he was last seen a little cloud of autumn leaves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
came scurrying. As they neared the wall
of the house where the wind by pressure veered
skyward to clear the roof, some of the leaves
were caught up and dashed against the windowpanes
behind which the doctor was standing.
Had the sash been raised, they would have
thrown themselves into his arms and have clung
to his neck and breast.</p>

<p class="indent">He did not know why, but they caused him
a pang: those little brown parchments torn
from the finished volume of the year: they
caused him a subtle pang.</p>

<p class="indent">He turned from the window, goaded by more
than resolution, and crossed to his writing-desk
on the opposite side: there lay the work mapped
out for the morning. No interruptions were to
be expected from his patients, though of course
there might be new patients since accidents and
illnesses befall unheralded. There would be no
visitors&mdash;not to-day. In a country of the
warmest social customs and of family ties so
widely interknit that whole communities are
bound together as with vine-like closeness, no
one visits on the day before Christmas. In every
little town the world of people crowd the streets
and shops or busy themselves in preparations at
home: out in the country those who have not
flocked to the towns are as joyously occupied.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
No visitors, then. And the children were gone&mdash;no
disturbances from their romping. The servants
had put his rooms in order, and were too
discreetly trained to return upon their paths.</p>

<p class="indent">After breakfast, at the stable, he had given
orders to his man for the day while he was having
a look at his horses&mdash;well-stalled, well-groomed,
docile, intelligent: at his gaited saddle-horse,
at the nag for his buggy, at the perfectly
matched pair for his carriage. As he appeared
in the doorway of the stalls, each beast, turning
his head, had sent to him its affectionate greeting
out of eyes that looked like wells of soft blue
smoke: each said, &quot;Take me to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was a little vain of being weatherwise, as
is apt to be the case with country-bred folk:
and at the last stable door, having studied the
wind and the sky and the temperature, he had
said to his man that the weather was changing:
it would be snowing by afternoon. Usually in
that latitude the first flurry of snow gladdens
the eye near Thanksgiving, but sleighs are not
often flying until late in December. There had
been no snow as yet; it was due, and the weather
showed signs of its multitudinous onset.</p>

<p class="indent">He felt so sure in his forecast that he had
instructed his man to put the sleigh in readiness.
He himself went into the saddle-house and from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
a peg amid the gear and harness he took down
the sleighbells. As he shook them roughly, he
smiled as above that cascade of mellow winter
sounds there settled a little cloud of summer
dust. He observed that the leather needed
mending&mdash;what he called &quot;a few surgical
stitches&quot;; and he had brought the bells with
him to the house and they now lay on the floor
of his office in the adjoining room.</p>

<p class="indent">He thought that if it should snow heavily
enough he would use the sleigh when he started
out in the afternoon. There were several sick
children to visit on opposite horizons of his
neighborhood. The sound of the bells as he
drove in at their front gates might have value:
it would not only mean the coming of his sleigh,
but it would suggest to them the approach of
that mysterious Sleigh of the World which that
night they were expecting. Afterwards he was
to go to a distant county seat for a consultation.
His road home was a straight turnpike: it would
be late when he returned, perhaps far in the
night; and he would have the sound of the
bells to himself&mdash;the bells and his thoughts and
Christmas Eve.</p>

<p class="indent">This plan of Dr. Birney&#39;s regarding the
children laid bare one of his ideas as a physician.
For years he had employed increasingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
in his practice the power of suggestion. For
years life as he sometimes surmised had employed
the power of suggestion on him. He
felt assured that in treating the sick there are
cases where every suggestion of happiness that
can reach a patient draws him back toward
life: every suggestion of unhappiness lowers his
vitality and helps to roll him over the precipice:
the final push need be a very slight one.
The melody of sleighbells falling on the ears
of the sick children that afternoon might have
the weight of a sunbeam on delicate scales and
tip the balances as he wished: he believed that
many a time the weight of a mental sunbeam
was all that was needed to decide the issue.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at his watch. It was ten o&#39;clock,
and dinner was served at one, and he had a
tranquil outlook for three hours of work. The
only remaining source from which an interruption
could have reached him was his wife. His
wife!&mdash;his wife never&mdash;intruded.</p>

<p class="indent">Not three hours, but two hours and a half,
to be exact; for the dining-room adjoined his
library, and every day at half past twelve
o&#39;clock his wife entered the dining-room to
superintend final preparations for dinner: from
the instant of her entrance concentration of
mind ended for him: he occupied himself with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
things less important and with odds and ends
for mind and body.</p>

<p class="indent">She would draw the shades of the windows
delicately to temper the light according as the
day was cloudy or cloudless; she would bring
fresh flowers for the table; she would inspect
the clearness of the cut glass, the brightness of
the silver, the snowiness of the napkins; she
would prepare at the sideboard a salad, a
sauce; she would give a final push to the
chairs&mdash;last of all a straightening push to his.
All the lower drudgery of the servants and all
the higher domestic triumphs of her skill led
to his chair&mdash;as to a kind of throne where the
function of feeding reigned. With that final
adjustment of the piece of furniture in which
his body was to be at ease while it gorged itself,
with that act of grade, the doors were opened;
dinner was announced; he walked in, and faced
his wife, and dined&mdash;with Nemesis.</p>

<p class="indent">This pride of hers in housekeeping was part
of her inheritance, of the civilization of her
land and people: it was a little separate dynasty
of itself. Often as the years had gone by he
had been thankful that she could thus far find
compensation for larger disappointment; it
helped to keep her a healthy woman if it could
not render her a happy wife. Near the sugar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
and the flour she could perhaps three times a
day realize small perfections; she could mould
little ideals and turn them out on the shelf and
verify them with a silver spoon: an ideal life
in the pantry for a woman who had expected
an ideal life with him in library and parlor
and bedroom and out in the world. It was
all as if she sat at the base of Love&#39;s ruined
Pyramids and tried to divert her desolation by
configuring ant hills.</p>

<p class="indent">And he was well aware that this pride of
housekeeping was the least of all the prides that
grouped themselves around that central humiliation
of wifehood. He had sometimes thought
that if, after her death, over her were planted
a weeping willow, mere nutritive pride in her
dust would force the boughs to reverse their
natural direction and shoot upward as stiff
as a spruce.</p>

<p class="indent">The dining-room, in the old-fashioned Kentucky
way, was richly carpeted; but the
moment she set her foot within it, he could
trace her steps as unerringly as though she had
been shod with explosives. Likewise she sang
to herself a good deal: (he had long ago diagnosed
that symptom of nervous self-consciousness).</p>

<p class="indent">When he had married her, voice and piano
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
had been one of the resources he thought he
would hold in reserve for the emptying years;
music would fill so much rational silence. It
was one of his semi-serious declarations that only
two people more or less out of their senses
could keep on talking to each other till death
forced them to hold their tongues. But with
tragic swiftness and sureness a few years after
their marriage the music stopped, the piano
was shut.</p>

<p class="indent">More than that terminated. After two children
were born, there were no more: that profound
living music came to an end also. And
perhaps one of the deepest desires of his nature
was for that kind of long union with his wife
and for many children: perhaps the only
austerity in him was an austere patriarchal
authority to people the earth and to bequeath
the inheritance of it to his seed.</p>

<p class="indent">When she had ceased singing to him soon
after marriage, she had begun to sing to herself&mdash;habitually
during this half-hour of proximity.
The sound took up a fixed abode in
his ear as there is a roaring in a seashell. He
could hear it miles across the country; it was
the loudest sound to him in this world&mdash;that
barely audible self-conscious singing of his wife.</p>

<p class="indent">During this interval also she addressed her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
commands to the maid in tones lowered not to
disturb him. He could not hear the words,
but there was no mistaking the tones! What
beautiful, eager, victorious, thrilling tones&mdash;over
a dish of steaming vegetables&mdash;over a
savory toast! They forced him to be reminded
that the nature of his wife was not a brook run
dry; its leaping waters were merely turned
away into another channel. Only when she
spoke with him did the cadence of her tones
sag; then all the modulations ran downhill as
into some inner pit of emptiness.</p>

<p class="indent">It was impossible for him to believe that the
occasional chuckle and cackle of the maid during
these whispered colloquies grew out of
aspersions winged at him&mdash;at the hungry ogre,
middle-aged, almost corpulent, on the other
side of the wall; at the species of advanced
gorilla, poorly disguised in collar and necktie
and midway garments; and with wool and
leather drawn over his lower pair of modernized
walking hands! Yet the truth was undeniable
that when dinner was announced and
he went in, the maid, standing behind her
mistress&#39;s chair, fixed her gaze on him with
fresh daily delight in understanding or misunderstanding
the wretchedness of the household.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
The first time he had ever seen this maid was
one evening upon going in to supper. They
were expecting guests, and his wife wore an
evening gown. As he seated himself, he became
aware almost without glancing across the
table that something novel had arrived upon
the scene&mdash;something youthful yet as immemorial
as Erebus. Behind the glistening
whiteness of his wife&#39;s bust with its cold proud
dignity, there was something sable&mdash;birdlike&mdash;all
beak and eyes&mdash;with a small head on
which grew a kind of ruffled indignant feathers.
He tried to take no further notice of the apparition,
but could not escape the experience that
several times during the meal he rescued his
biscuit as from between the claws of a competing
raven.</p>

<p class="indent">In the course of time, as this combination of
black and white refused to dissolve and rather
coalesced into a duality holding good for meal
hours, he felt impelled to characterize the alliance&mdash;to
envisage for his own relief the totality
of its comic gloom. So he called it his <i>Bust of
Pallas</i> and his <i>Nevermore</i>. And his <i>Nevermore</i>,
perched behind his <i>Bust of Pallas</i> at every function,
fixed her dull stupid eyes on him in unceasing
judgment. He was never quite persuaded
of the human reality of her; never fully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
believed that she reached to the carpet: and he
never got up from the table to see whether she
cast a shadow on the floor; but he knew that
it was the fowl&#39;s intention to cast whatsoever
shadow it carried about with it <i>upon him</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">She had become a critic of his domestic relations.
This servant, this mal-arrangement of
beak and eyes, with bare brain enough not to
let plates fall and not to dangle her fingers in
scalding water nor singe her head-feathers in the
oven&mdash;this servant of his arraigned <i>him</i> in his
humanity! And if this servant, then all his
servants. And if all his servants, then all the
servants of the neighborhood. The whole
Plutonian shore croaked its black damnation of
him. Of <i>him</i>!&mdash;the leading citizen of his
community, its central vital character who held
in his keeping the destiny of a people! He
had a vision of the august assemblage of them
uplifted into the heavenliness of an African
Walhalla&mdash;such as is disclosed in the last act of
the <i>Tetralogy</i>&mdash;all gazing down upon him as a
profaning Alberic who had raped the virgin
Gold of marital love.</p>

<p class="indent">On a near peak of especial moral grandeur, his
<i>Nevermore</i> stood in her supernal resentment of
his wife&#39;s wrong. For whatever <i>Nevermore</i> was
not, at least, she was woman. And what woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
fails to espouse any wife&#39;s dignity except the
woman who supplants the wife? (Not even she;
for if ever in turn her hour comes, her first outcry
is, &#39;I might have known.&#39;)</p>

<p class="indent">Dr. Birney did not have three hours for this
morning&#39;s business, then, but two hours and a
half; and forthwith beginning, he took from his
breast-pocket a small book and transferred
from it to a large diary his notes of visits to
patients on the day preceding. This soon done,
he was ready for the main work.</p>

<p class="indent">It was now the closing week of the year when
according to custom he posted the year&#39;s books;
for he was his own secretary. By New Year&#39;s
Day his accounts were about ready and new
books were opened.</p>

<p class="indent">He always took up with repugnance this
valuation of his services. It was to him one of
life&#39;s ironies that in order to live he must take
toll of death. He must harvest his bread from
the fields of tears. He must catch his annual
treasure from those rainbows of hope that
spanned weary pillows. He must fill his wine-jar
by dipping his cup into the waves of Lethe.
He must equip his very stable with the ferriage
he had collected on the banks of the Styx.</p>

<p class="indent">His heart was never in his bookkeeping; this
morning he could barely fix upon it his thoughts;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
so that before commencing he allowed himself
to turn the leaves, getting a distasteful bird&#39;s-eye
view of this panorama of neighborhood
suffering and mortality there outspread on the
table.</p>

<p class="indent">Two infants in January had had scarlet fever;
so much for the infants and the fever. A boy
had had measles; an assessment for measles. A
girl had had mumps; the price of mumps. An
old lady, going one bitter February afternoon
to her hen-house to see whether the hens had
begun to lay, had slipped on the ice-covered step
and had fractured her hip-bone; damages for
the friable hip-bone of the senile. A negro man,
stationed in an ice-house to knock to pieces with
an axe the blocks of ice as they were hauled
from the pond, had had his feet frost-bitten. In
April a stable-boy had been kicked in the groin
and bitten in the shoulder by a stallion. This
stallion, in whom survived the fighting traits of
the wild horse and defiance of man as an enemy
who had no use for him but to enslave him and
work him to death, had already killed two stablemen.
Too valuable for the stud to be himself
killed, and too dangerous to be approached or
handled, it was decided to destroy his eyesight;
and the doctor had been called in to treat both
stable-boy and stallion. There was a bill for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
his services to the boy; none for the stallion; he
was not a veterinary. But it was his hand that
had jabbed the long needle into those virile unconquerable
eyes&mdash;leaving that Samson Agonistes
of the herd whose only crime had been to reject
civilization, as was his right. There was no one
to put out the doctor&#39;s eyes, who also had rejected
civilization: which was not his right.</p>

<p class="indent">In June a lad, climbing a cherry tree with the
ambition to capture the earliest cherries dangling
scarlet, had fallen flat upon his back when
the limb had split from the half-rotten trunk,
thus jarring his spine. It was a bad case; he
must now make out a good bill for it, otherwise
the father would feel resentful.</p>

<p class="indent">In harvest time one of his friends, a young
farmer, overheated, went bathing too soon in a
fresh-water pond&mdash;made cooler by a recent
hail-storm; between the leaves lay a note from
his widow, with its deep black border and its
mourning perfume; she had asked for the account&mdash;had
asked punctiliously to pay for a beloved
young husband&#39;s fatal chill. In autumn
two barefoot half-grown brothers were cutting
ironweeds in a pasture with hemphooks; the
elder by too heavy a stroke had sent his blade
clean through a clump of weeds into the ankle
of the younger, slashing it to the bone.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
Thus the record ran on as the doctor turned
the pages in a preliminary survey of his chart
of suffering. And then there were the cases of
those coming into the world and the cases of
those going out: birth-rates, death-rates. He
must exact of Nature his fee for continuing
the existence of the human race; and he must
go about among his friends and neighbors and
wring money out of them because those they
loved best had merely paid their own decent
debt to mortality.</p>

<p class="indent">He dipped his pen into the ink, drew before
him some blanks, and began to make out the
bills. The rooms were very quiet and comfortable;
winter sunshine entered through the windows;
the Christmas wind frolicked outside the
walls.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">To be forced to sit there and say to the world:
My feelings have nothing to do with it: you
must pay what you owe! Because all life
is payment; everything is a settlement. There
is but one that is exempt&mdash;Nature. It is
only she who never fails to collect a debt but
who never pays one. Who that has ever lived
our common human life, borne its burdens, felt
its cares, fought against its wrongs, who but
knows that Nature is in debt to him? But what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
son of hers has ever been able to tear his due
from her!</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">More may be learned about the doctor by
an inspection of his rooms. Of these there were
three, with a small fourth chamber as an ell in
the house: in this ell there was a single bed,
and here he sometimes slept&mdash;as nearly outside
the house as it was possible to lie and still to
be within it.</p>

<p class="indent">The room in which he now worked was his
library; communicating through an open door
was his office; beyond the office through another
open door was a third room in which were stored
many personal articles of indoor and outdoor use.</p>

<p class="indent">Beginning with his office, you derived the
knowledge which any physician&#39;s and surgeon&#39;s
office, if modern and complete, should afford.
On one wall hung his diploma from a New York
Medical College; on another a diploma from
Vienna for post-graduate study and hospital
work.</p>

<p class="indent">The rooms taken together bore testimony in
their entire equipment to a general outside
truth: that the physician who lived in them
was not a country doctor because he had been
crowded by abler members of the profession out
of the cities where there are many into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
country where there are none: and this fact in
turn had its larger historic significance.</p>

<p class="indent">Almost within a generation a radical change
has taken place in the relation of town and
country as regards the profession of medicine.
The old barriers which half a century ago separated
the sick in the streets from the sick in
fields and forests have been swept away. The
city physician now twenty-five miles away can
often arrive more quickly than a country doctor
who lives five; and a surgeon can come in an
hour who formerly needed half a day. But
many now living with long memories can well
remember the time when the country doctor
ruled in his neighborhood as the priest in mediæval
Europe swayed his parish. However remote,
he was always sent for. His form was the
very image of rescue, his face was the light of
healing. As a consequence, the country often
developed leaders in the profession. Instead
of its being dependent upon the cities, these
looked to the rural districts for many of the
most skilful practitioners.</p>

<p class="indent">This was strikingly true from the earliest
settlement of the West on that immense plateau
of forest and grass land which has long since
drawn to itself the notice of the world as the
loveliness of Kentucky. It was on the southern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
boundary of this plateau, living in a pioneer
hamlet and practising far and wide through a
wilderness, that a country doctor became the
father of ovarian surgery in the United States
and won the reverence of the world of science and
the gratitude of humanity. In another pioneer
settlement one of the greatest of American
lithotomists spread the lustre of his name and
the goodness of his deeds over the whole country
west of the Alleghany Mountains; and these
were but two of those many country doctors
who there for well-nigh a century were the
reliance of their people: physicians, surgeons,
diagnosticians, nurses, pharmacists, friends&mdash;all
in one.</p>

<p class="indent">This powerful and brilliant tradition had
descended to Dr. Birney, and he had worthily
upheld it. In some respects he had solidly
advanced it, notably in his treatment of children&#39;s
diseases.</p>

<p class="indent">A second room, in which the articles of his
personal life were kept, gave further knowledge
of him as a man. Outside the windows there
was a tennis court; he played tennis with his
children and with young people of the neighborhood.
You saw his racquet on the wall; and
if you had opened a closet, you would have
found the flannels and the shoes. Elsewhere on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
the wall you saw his reel. In season he liked to
fish, when his patients also could go fishing, or at
least were well enough to feel like going; and in
the same closet you might have noted the residue
of a fisherman&#39;s outfit. He fished not only for
black bass, but for that mild pond and creek
fish prized as a delicacy on Kentucky tables&mdash;a
variety of the calico bass known in the local
vocabulary as &quot;newlight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Still elsewhere you saw his game bag and bird
gun&mdash;he liked to call it by the older word,
fowling-piece. He hunted: quail, doves, wild
duck. In another closet you would have been
interested to discover his regalia as a member
of the Order of Masons; and well placed beside
it his uniform as a member of the State Guard&mdash;the
two well placed there. When years before
his neighbors had enrolled him in the Guard,
they had saluted him as one more Kentucky
Colonel. &quot;I will submit to no official degradation,&quot;
he had said; &quot;I am already the Commander
of the whole army of you on the field
of your human Waterloo: salute your General!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His library added its testimony as to other
humanities. Scattered about on tables and
mantel-piece were fine old pipes and boxes of
cigars and playing-cards. There were poker
chips, showing that the doctor had poker neighbors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
(where else if not there?), though whist
was his game. You realized that he was a man
at home among a people who loved play&mdash;must
have play. On his sideboard were temperate
decanters: he had sideboard neighbors. Altogether
a human-looking room for much that
is human; easy to enter, comfortable to stay
in, hard to quit.</p>

<p class="indent">But our closest friends can come so close to
us and no closer; they surround us but none of
them enters us. Nature forbids that any but our
own feet should cross the bridge spanning the distance
between other people and the fortress of
the individual. Across that bridge we can take
with us no companions except those that keep
silent amid its silences; that can speak to us
but that cannot see us: those great voices
without eyes; those great listeners without ears;
great counsellors without criticism; great hands
that guide and refuse to smite; great judges
that embody law and refuse to sit in judgment
on us&mdash;Books.</p>

<p class="indent">Some of the doctor&#39;s books held for him life&#39;s
indispensable laughter; and no one of us ever
tells all the things in this world that we laugh at.
Some held for him life&#39;s tears; and no one of us
ever tells the things that secretly start our own.
Some held neither laughter nor tears but what is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
above both&mdash;life&#39;s calm; and what one of us
but at times feels the need to ascend to some
inner mountain-top of our own spirits&mdash;far
above the whole darkened or radiant cloud-rack
of emotion&mdash;and look futureward into the
promised peace, the end of our wandering.
Joys&mdash;sorrows&mdash;and calm: these three for
him, too.</p>

<p class="indent">Such books stayed with the doctor year after
year. He could wake in the night and find
them through the darkness; in the darkness
they knew how to find him. They were not
part of his medical library, of course, which was
another matter. But they filled three sides of
a large low revolving bookcase in the middle
of the room beside his easy chair and his lamp
and table.</p>

<p class="indent">The fourth side of his bookcase held the books
that came and went as a stream, entering and
passing on: he drank from them as they flowed
by. Always they were books of fiction or biography
which held in solution the truth of the
human matter about some life that had fought
or was fighting its path through to victory.
Always he would have books of victory. By
preference it must be a story real or imagined of
some boy, youth, young man, middle-aged man,
who was in the struggle for existence and who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
was on the side of survival. He kept in mind
the words of a great Frenchman that the way to
make an impression upon the world is to plough
through humanity like a cannon-ball or to creep
through it like a pestilence. But he knew that in
this world there are very few human cannonballs,
though of such pestilence there is always
more than enough. Rather every common man&#39;s
life, and every uncommon man&#39;s life, is a drawn
sword that has to cut its way through all other
drawn swords. Here were the books which
disclosed the mettle of a character: the last
magnificent refusal to be ruined by evil which
is the very breath of a man and the slow measure
of the world&#39;s advance. So that, while much is
always failing in everybody, all is never failing.
Out of the blackest abyss there arises in the
wounded and prostrate some white peak of
unmelting innocence&mdash;at the base of which
Life&#39;s battle rages.</p>

<p class="indent">Many a time long after midnight he would
read to a finish some such triumphant story;
and with a murmur of &quot;Well done!&quot; he would
close the book, turn out his lamp, and go to sleep
in his chair with his clothes on&mdash;with that scene
of victory emptying its echoes into his ear and
his dreams.</p>

<p class="indent">Here, then, was some discrete knowledge of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
doctor as a doctor and as a man. But there
was one thing in his library that blended these
two separate aspects, showing how the man felt
as a physician and how the physician felt as a
man. This was a series of pictures running
around the walls and connecting great epochs in
the progress of Medicine.</p>

<p class="indent">He had a liking, as the world has, for some
brief series of climaxes that will depict a subject
at a glance. Very memorable to him was
Shakespeare&#39;s Seven Ages&mdash;because they were
seven and were thus easily grasped by poetry
and reason. But he knew that Shakespeare
might as truly have substituted another seven&mdash;with
as good poetry and reason; or he
might have made the ages fourteen or forty-nine
or forty-nine hundred; for actually the
ages of a man&#39;s life are infinite; but being reduced
to seven, we all recognize them.</p>

<p class="indent">And memorable to him likewise had been
Hogarth&#39;s <i>Progress of the Rake</i> with its few pictures;
and his <i>Progress of the Harlot</i> with its few;
and his <i>Progress of Marriage à la Mode</i> with its
few; and the <i>Progress of Cruelty</i> with its fewest
of all&mdash;only four, but more than enough! And
yet the stages in the progress of the rake and
of the harlot and of marriage à la mode and of
cruelty are infinite; and at no single stage in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
the progress of any one of them could you actually
find either Rake or Harlot or Infidelity or
Cruelty. Being portrayed as few, the world understands
and finds its own account in them.</p>

<p class="indent">So around the walls of his library there hung
a series of pictures showing the progress of
Medicine across the ages.</p>

<p class="indent">The first picture represented a scene in the
life of primitive man, during the period when
he had long enough been man to form into
hostile tribes, but not long enough to have advanced
far from the boundaries of the brute.
It is a battle picture: the battle is over: the
survivors are gone: the dead and wounded lie
about. Medicine as a human science has not
yet been born; surgery has not yet separated
itself from the movements of instinct. Yet
there was activity among the wounded. In
some of the warriors you saw such attempts in
the care of their wounds as one may witness
to-day in wounded birds and animals&mdash;if one
is fortunate enough to be so placed as to be able
to watch: there were the instinctive devices to
cleanse, to protect, to alleviate: those low beginnings
of the great science which you may observe
to-day in your dog when he has come home
after a fight with lacerated ears and slashed
thighs&mdash;when he crawls under the porch to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
the darkest corner to keep away other dogs
and light and flies; whose sole instrument of
cleansing is his tongue and whose only bathing
fluid is saliva. On that battle-field you saw
such beginnings of surgery as to-day is practised
by a bird treating its broken wing or
broken leg. Thus the wounded warriors concerned
themselves with their hurts&mdash;all mother-naked.
Along one edge of the battle-field was a
stream of running water; some had started to
draw themselves toward this and had died on the
way. One was stretched full alongside&mdash;a young
chief of magnificent proportions and a face of
higher intelligence. And out of that intelligence,
as a marvellous advance in the development of
man, you saw one action: he was dipping up
water in the palm of his hand and pouring it
upon his wound. At some moment in the history
of the race there must somewhere have
been that first movement of the developing
animal to substitute water for saliva. That
great historic moment was depicted there. It
was still the Azoic Age of Medicine.</p>

<p class="indent">Near by hung a second picture. Ages have
passed, no one knows how many. The brute
has become Prometheus; he has learned the use
of fire; and he has learned the most heroic
application of flame&mdash;to touch it to himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
where he is in greatest agony: that is, he
has learned to cauterize his wounds. More
than fire can he now handle; he has learned to
bring together fat and flame; and he has discovered
how from flame to produce oil; and he
has learned to pour boiling oil into the holes in
his body made by the implements of war. It
is the long Ages of Medicine for the cautery and
burning oil.</p>

<p class="indent">A third picture hung next. More ages have
passed, no one knows how many; and the
scene is another battle-field far down toward
modern times. It is France; it is the second
half of the sixteenth century; it is warfare in
Piedmont. Troops are sweeping up the hill, and
in the background is a walled city with turrets
and towers; and in the foreground wounded
soldiers are arriving or are lying about on the
ground. There is a rude mass of masonry used
as an operating-table; and on the operating-table
is a soldier, one of whose legs has just been amputated
above the knee; an attendant holds the
saw with which the leg has just been sawed off, and
the stump of it has dropped below. Beside the
wounded man stand two figures: one the figure
of the past; and the other a figure of the future&mdash;a
poor barber&#39;s apprentice, father of modern
surgery, named to be massacred on St. Bartholomew&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
eve, but spared because none but a despised
Huguenot could be found in all France skilful
enough to safeguard the royal orthodox blood.
There beside the soldier they stand, these two, and
in them ages meet; for the figure of the past holds
in his hand one of the cauteries that are kept
redhot in a brazier near his feet; and the other
holds in his a new thing in the world&mdash;a simple
ligature. A great scene, a great epoch: the
beginning of new surgery when the flowing of
blood from amputations of the great arteries
could be stopped by a mere bandage: that man&mdash;Ambroise
Paré!</p>

<p class="indent">More centuries have passed&mdash;we know
exactly how many now from year to year. It
is the nineteenth, and it is the New World; the
next picture on the library wall portrayed a
scene on the Western frontier of a new civilization.
It is the backwoods of Kentucky, it is
a pioneer settlement of three or four hundred
souls, nearly a thousand miles from any hospital
or dissecting-room. In the front door of
his rude pioneer house stands a Kentucky
country doctor, Ephraim MacDowell. His patient
is before him, a woman on horseback in a
side-saddle. She has just arrived, having ridden
some seventy miles through the wilderness.
He is assisting her to alight; and he is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
soon to perform, without consultation, without
precedent in the ages of surgery (but not without
a prayer for himself and her), by strength of
his own will and nerve and by the light of the
solitary candle of his own genius, an operation
which made Kentucky the mother of ovarian surgery
for all coming time, a new epoch of life and
mercy: he going his own way to immortality as
Shakespeare went his, as the greatest always go
theirs&mdash;by a new path untrumpeted and alone.</p>

<p class="indent">Another picture represented a scene in Boston
in 1846, less than half a century later; for the
lonely mountain peaks of progress stretching
across the ages are beginning to crowd each
other now; they are beginning to run together
into a range of continuous discovery. That
picture also shows an operating-room; and there
stood the American Morton, making for the
world the first merciful use of anæsthetics:
with which the silence of painlessness fell upon
humanity&#39;s old outcry of torture under treatment.</p>

<p class="indent">There the doctor&#39;s pictures ended. In our
own time he might have added one more for
the epoch of the Roentgen Ray and another for
the Finsen Light; and another for transfusion
of blood; and still others crowning other mountain-tops
in the new Surgery and new Medicine.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
Thus he had before his eyes in his library
some few Ages of his Science&mdash;as it went
forward and slipped back and missed the road
and forgot the road, yet somehow steadily
advanced across the centuries like an erring
unconquerable man across his years. Not
progressing however as a man grows, from
infancy to decrepitude; but moving from its
old age toward its youth, always toward its
youth, as Swedenborg&#39;s Angels fly forever
toward their Spring. It ran around his walls
like a great roadway, connecting the last discoveries
of his Science with the surgery of the
wolf who gnaws off his imprisoned leg and with
the medicine of the sick dog that eats grass.</p>

<p class="indent">He called it his World&#39;s Path of Lessening
Pain.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the last refuge and solace of his often
tired and often wounded mind. Even after
friends were gone at night and the poker chips
were stacked or the whist counters folded;
after the sideboard had been visited and temperately
forsaken; after the abiding books had
done for him what they could; in the still
house far into the night, he would sometimes
lie back in his chair and survey those battle-pictures
of a science on which he was spending
his loyalty and his strength.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
Once, in younger days, outside the Eternal
City, he had gone to study those fragments
of the Old Roman Aqueduct that to-day are
slowly crumbling on the Campagna; and
standing alone before it he had in imagination
searched for the figure of some young workman
who had helped to mould those brick or to
finish those columns: the figure of some obscure
vanished peasant. So the great wall of
his science, being built onward across the centuries
into the future, would be revisited by
men of the future in places where it stood in
ruins. He would be as one whose life with its
mistakes was yet linked to indestructible good.
He would vanish from beside the wall himself,
but his work upon it would have helped to
uphold humanity. And many a night he went
asleep in his chair, committing himself to his
Science, as the forgotten Roman laborer of old
may have fallen asleep under his own arch.</p>

<p class="indent">But, in that same Italy, northward are the
Apennines; and sometimes in travelling through
these or through the Swiss glaciers where Nature
measures all things on the scale of the sublime&mdash;sometimes
as your eye is passing from snow
peak to snow peak, suddenly away up on some
mountain-side you will see a human hut; and
standing in the door of that hut a single human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
being; and the thought may come to you that
there, in the heart of that pygmy, may dwell
sorrow that dwarfs the Alps.</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor&#39;s library had such a picture: it
completed the story of the room, and it effaced
everything else in it. In a somewhat darkened
corner hung a framed photograph of his wife
in her bridal dress made not long after their
wedding. Once his photograph had hung beside
it. The plaster where the nail had been driven
in had either fallen out or it had been torn out.
He never knew&mdash;he knew enough not to ask.</p>

<p class="indent">As for the photograph, there stood a young
bride, looking into her future and trying to conceal
from herself what she saw soon awaiting
her: the life of a woman wedded but not loved.
And there was recollection in the eyes too:
that the man who had married her perhaps in
the very breath of his wooing had wished she
were another; that at the altar he had perhaps
wished he were putting his ring upon another&#39;s
hand; and that if there were to be children,
he would always be wishing for them another
mother.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The doctor sat there that morning trying
to work at the books of the year. The rooms
were comfortable; the children were away at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
the fireside of another man&#39;s wife; the servants
did not dare disturb him; his horses waited in
their stalls; it was the day on which he could
begin to reap his golden harvest&mdash;a pleasant
day for most men; but he could not see the
blanks before him nor remember the names he
filled in nor the figures that were for value
received.</p>

<p class="indent">Because there lay open before him the Book
of the Years.</p>

<p class="indent">And coming down toward him on the track
of memory through this book was his life from
boyhood to middle age: first the playing feet
of the child that have no path as yet; then the
straight path of the boy; then the winding
road of youth; then the quickly widened road,
so smooth, so easy, of a young man; and then
the fixed deepening rut of middle age.</p>

<p class="indent">And now the rut of middle age had come to
its forks: north fork and south fork; or east
fork and west fork&mdash;he must choose.</p>

<p class="indent">Whoso cares to know where and how the
doctor&#39;s life-path started and across what kind
of country it had run until now, a middle-aged
man, he sat there this day at the tragedy of its
forking, may if he so choose follow the road by
the chart of a narrative.</p>

<p class="indent">But let him remember that this narrative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
goes back into a society unlike that of to-day
and into a Kentucky that has vanished. Back
there are other manners, other customs, other
types of men: a different light on the world
altogether.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p class="h2">THE BOOK OF THE YEARS</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">More</span> than half a century ago, or during the
decade of 1850 and 1860, when American life
on the fertile plain of Kentucky attained its
ripest flavor, there was living with great ease
to himself and others on a large estate in one of
the bluegrass counties a country gentleman and
farmer who was nothing more: nothing more
because that was enough. Being farmer took
up much of his time, and being a gentleman
took up the rest.</p>

<p class="indent">He one day observed that his prolific heels
were beginning to be trodden upon by a group
of stalwart sons nearing manhood; or, in the
idiom of that picturesque soil, all thickly bunched
in their race for the grand stand. According
to the robust family life of that era and
people, a year or less was often the interval
between births; and a father, slanting his eyes
upward to his oldest who had just reached
twenty-one, might catch a glimpse of a fourth
son smiling loyally at him from the top of the
rank stalk of eighteen.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
This juvenescent and prodigal sire clearly
foreseeing, as many of his neighbors foresaw, the
emancipation of the negroes and the downfall
of the Southern feudal system and thus the
downfall of the Kentucky gentleman of the
feudal soil, could see no further. When those
grapes then ripening went into the winepress of
destiny, there would be no more like them: the
stock would be cut down, a new vineyard would
have to be planted; and what might become of his
sons as laborers in that vineyard he knew not,
though looking wistfully forth. Therefore he
determined to store them away for their own
safeguard among those ancestral professions
alike of the Old and New World that are
exempt from political vicissitude and dynastic
changes.</p>

<p class="indent">Now it happened that among his friends he
counted the great Dr. Benjamin Dudley, the
illustrious Kentucky lithotomist at Lexington;
and taking counsel of that learned and
kindly man, he chose for his first-born stalwart&mdash;since
the stalwart when invited to do so
declined to choose it for himself&mdash;the profession
of medicine; and having politely packed
his trunk, he politely packed him with a polite
body servant and a polite good-by off to a
medical school, the best the Southern States
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
then boasted&mdash;and the Southern States knew
how to boast in those days.</p>

<p class="indent">But the colt that has been dragged to the
water cannot be forced to drink; and the semi-docile
son could not be made to introduce into
his system his father&#39;s professional prescription.
His presence at the medical school was evidence
in its way that he had swallowed the prescription;
but his conduct as a student showed that
by his own will he had inhibited its action
upon his vital parts.</p>

<p class="indent">In the year of finishing his course of lectures
his father died; and upon returning home certificated
as a doctor, he returned also as a young
blood of independent fortune, independent
future, and independent Feelings&mdash;the last
of which, the Feelings, he regarded as by far
the most important of the three. At the bottom
of his trunk against the lining was his diploma,
on the principle that we pack first what we shall
need last.</p>

<p class="indent">The immediate use this golden youth made of
his liberty and his Feelings was to take over into
his control a share of the ancestral estate that
fell to him under our American laws of partible
inheritance; to build on it a low rambling
manor house; and into this to convey his
portion of the polished family silver and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
polished family blacks. Soon afterward with
no exertion on his part he married him a wife
in the neighborhood; tore up his diploma as if
to annihilate in his establishment the very recognition
of disease; laid off a training-track; and
proceeded to employ his languid energies in a
fashion which his father had not favored for any
of his sons&mdash;the breeding of Kentucky thoroughbreds.</p>

<p class="indent">Years passed. History came and went its
thundering way, leaving the nation like a
forest blasted with lightning and drenched with
rain. The Kentucky gentleman of the feudal
sort was gone, having disappeared in the clouds
of that history which had swept him from the
landscape.</p>

<p class="indent">The mild young Kentucky breeder mellowed
to his middle years, winning and losing on the
road as we all must, but with never a word about
it one way or the other from him; early losing
his wife and winning the makeshifts of widowerhood,
entering so to speak upon its restrictions;
losing his little daughter and winning a nephew
whom he adopted and idolized; letting him
run wild over the house, and then about the
yard, and then about the farm, and then across
boundary fences into other farms, and then into
the towns, and then out into the world.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
There were parts of his farm that looked like
English downs; and on these fed Southdown
sheep; for the Kentucky country gentleman
of that period killed his own mutton. (He
killed pretty much his own everything, even his
own neighbors.) No saddle of mutton out of a
public market house for him and for his groaning
mahogany. And so it seemed well-nigh a
romantic coincidence that the fatherless, motherless
boy who came to play on these downs should
have arrived there with the name of Downs
Birney.</p>

<p class="indent">The Kentucky turfman, with his Southdown
sheep and Durham cattle and White Berkshire
hogs and thoroughbred horses and Blue-dorking
chickens, was born, as may already have
been observed, with that Southern indolence
which occasionally equals the Oriental&#39;s; and
as more time passed he settled into the deeper
imperturbability of men who commit their
destiny to fast horses. Apparently they early
become so inoculated with hazard as to end in
being immune to all excitement. As he could
stroll over his farm without having to climb a
hill, he had perhaps preferred to build him a
low manor house so that he could lounge over it
without having to take the trouble to go upstairs.
In the chosen business of his life it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
would appear that he had wished to avail himself
of a principle of Old Roman law: that he
who does a thing through another does it himself;
and thus he could sit perfectly still on his
veranda with two legs and run nearly a mile a
minute on a track with four.</p>

<p class="indent">A rural Kentucky gentleman of dead-ripe
local pre-bellum flavor: exhaling a kind of
Falernian bouquet as he dwelt under the serene
blue sky on a beautiful bluegrass Sabine farm: a
warm-visaged, soft-handed, bland-voiced man&mdash;so
bland that when he strolled up to you
and accosted you, you were uncertain whether
he was going to offer to bet with you or to
baptize you. Season after season this tranquil
happy Kentuckian dwelt there, intent upon
making nothing of himself and upon making the
horse an adequate citizen of a state that likes
to go its own gait&mdash;and to make him a leading
citizen of the world: measurably he succeeded
in doing both.</p>

<p class="indent">As he receded from view, his horses advanced
into notice. He was probably never better
satisfied with his stable lot and with his human
lot than when at one of his annual sales he
could hear the auctioneer&mdash;that high-gingered
Pindar of the black walnut stump&mdash;arouse the
enthusiasm of the buyers by announcing that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
a certain three-year-old had as its sire the <i>Immortal
Cunctator</i> and that its dam was the peerless
<i>Swift Perdition</i>. Year after year he dwelt
there, contented in drinking the limestone water
of his hillside spring with his foals and his fillies;
drinking at his table the unskimmed milk of his
Durham dairy; and drinking indoors and outdoors
the waterproof beverage of a four-seasons
philosophic decanter. The decanter resembled
the limestone spring in this at least: that it
could never rise higher than being full and could
never be baled dry.</p>

<p class="indent">In the vernal season, as sole proprietor of all
this teeming rural bliss, he sat on the top rail of
a fence and witnessed the manufacture of the
hippic generations; in summer sat on the top rail
of another fence and saw his colts trained; in
autumn in the judges&#39; stand sat with a finger
on his watch and saw them win; in winter,
passing into a state of partial hibernation over
the study of pedigrees, his fingers plunged deep
in his beard, with comfortable mumblings and
fumblings that bore their analogy to a bear&#39;s
brumal licking of its paws.</p>

<p class="indent">A veritable Roman poet Horace of a man, with
yearlings as his odes&mdash;and with a few mules
for satires.</p>

<p class="indent">Surely possessed of some excellent Epicurean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
philosophy of his own in that he could live so
long in a wretched world and escape all wretchedness.
If storms broke over his head, he insisted
that the weather just then was especially fine;
if trouble knocked at the door, he announced
with regret from the inside that the door was
locked. Is there any wonder that, nobody
though he insisted upon being, his appearance
in public always attracted a crowd? For the
inhabitants of this world are always looking
for one happy inhabitant. His acquaintances
hurried to him as they would break into a playful
run for a barrel of lemonade at a woodland
picnic when they needed to be cooled; or as
they waited around a kettle of burgroo at a
barbecue in autumn when they wished to be
warmed. Hot or cold, they felt their need to
be sprayed as to their unquiet passions by his
streaming benevolence.</p>

<p class="indent">Always that benevolence. On two distinct
occasions he had placidly reduced by one the
entire meritorious population of central Kentucky;
and then with a clear countenance, had
presented himself at the bar of justice to be
cleared. Upon his technical acquittal, the
judge had casually said that no matter how
guilty he was, it would have been a much
fouler crime to hang a citizen with so innocent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
an expression; that the habitual look of innocence
was of more value in a homicidal community
than a verdict of guilty for two fits of
distemper!</p>

<p class="indent">If the world should last until Kentucky
passes out of history into the classic and the
mythological; if Daniel Boone and the Wilderness
Road should become Orion and the Milky
Way; if the capture of Betsy Calloway should
become the rape of Lucrece; if the two gigantic
Indian fighters, the Poe brothers, should
establish their claim to the authorship of those
Poems and Tales which even in our own time
are beginning to fall away from a mythical
personage,&mdash;hardly more than an emanation
of darkness, perhaps this unique Kentucky
gentleman who insisted upon being no one at all
will exhibit his beaming face in the heavens of
those ages as Charioteer to the Horses of the
Sun.</p>

<p class="indent">The sole warrant for here disturbing his
light repose under his patchwork of turf is
that he had taken to his hearthstone and
heart an orphan nephew, whose destiny it was
to be profoundly influenced by the environment
of heart and hearthstone: by this breeding
of horses, by the method of training them;
by that serene outlook upon the world and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
gayety of nature which attracted happiness to it
as naturally as the martin box in the yard drew
the martins. Possibly even more influenced
in the earlier years around that fireside where
there was no women, no mother, no father,
either; nor parent out of doors save the motherhood
of the near earth and the fatherhood of
the distant sky.</p>

<p class="indent">From the day when he arrived on that stock
farm its influences began their work upon him
and kept it up during years when he was not
aware. But in his own memory the first event
in the long series of events&mdash;the first scene of
all the scenes that made his Progress&mdash;occurred
when he was about fifteen years old. As the
middle-aged man, sitting in his library that
morning with the Book of the Years before him,
reviewed his life, his memory went straight back
to that event and stopped there as though it
were the beginning. Of course it was not the
beginning; of course he could not himself have
known where the beginning was or what it was;
but he did what we all do as we look back toward
childhood and try to open a road as far as
memory will reach,&mdash;we begin somewhere, and
the doctor began with his fifteenth year&mdash;as the
first scene of his Progress. But let that scene be
painted not as the doctor saw it: more nearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
as it was: he was too young to know all that
it contained.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a balmy Saturday afternoon of early
summer; and uncle and nephew were out in the
yard of the white and lemon-colored manor
house, enjoying the shade of some blossoming
locust trees. The uncle was sitting in a yellow
cane-bottom chair; and he had on a yellow nankeen
waistcoat and trousers; so that the chair
looked like an overgrown architectural harmony
attached to his dorsal raiment; and he had on
a pleated bosom shirt which had been polished
by his negro laundress with iron and paraffine
until it looked like a cake of winter ice marked
off to be cut in slices. In the top button-hole was
a cluster diamond pin which represented almost
a star-system; and about his throat was tied a
magenta cravat: that was the day for solferinos
and magentas and Madeira wine. But the neck
of the wearer of the cravat was itself turning to
a gouty magenta; so that the ribbon, while
appropriately selected, was as a color-sign
superfluous. On the grass beside him lay his
black alpaca coat and panama hat and gold-headed
cane and red silk handkerchief and a
piece of dry wood admirable for whittling.</p>

<p class="indent">He had been to a colt show that morning
several miles across the country in a neighborhood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
where there was some turbulence; not the
turbulence of the colts; and he had reached
home just before dinner&mdash;glad to get there
without turbulence; and the dinner had been
good, and now he was experiencing that comfortable
expansion of girth which turns even a
pessimist toward optimism; that streaming
benevolence of his countenance never streamed
to better advantage.</p>

<p class="indent">He was reading his Saturday weekly newspaper,
an entire page of which showed that this
was a great thoroughbred breeding-region of the
world. At the distance of several yards you
could have inferred as much by the character
of the advertisements, each of which was headed
by the little black wood-cut of a stallion. The
page was blackened by this wood-cut as it
repeated itself up and down, column after
column. Whether the stallion were sorrel or
roan or bay or chestnut or black&mdash;one wood-cut
stood for all. There was one other wood-cut
for jacks&mdash;all jacks.</p>

<p class="indent">In the same way one little wood-cut in an
earlier generation had been used to stand for
runaway slaves: a negro with a stick swung
across his shoulder and with a bundle dangling
from the stick down his fugitive back; one
wood-cut for all slaves. If you saw between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
the legs of the figure, it was a man; if you did
not&mdash;it was the other figure of man&#39;s fate in
slavery.</p>

<p class="indent">The turfman read every item of his newspaper,
having first with a due sense of proportion
cast his eye on the advertisement of his own stud.</p>

<p class="indent">The nephew was lying on the grass near by,
wearing a kind of dove-colored suit; so that from
a distance he might have been taken for a huge
mound of vegetable mould; he having just
awakened from a nap: a heavy, rank, insolent,
human cub with his powers half pent up and
half unfolded, except a fully developed insolence
toward all things and people except
his uncle, himself, and his friend, Fred Ousley.
He rolled drowsily about on the soft turf, waiting
to take his turn at the newspaper: it was
the only thing he read: otherwise he was too
busy reading the things of life on the farm.
Once he stretched himself on his back, looking
upward for anything and everything in sight.
The light breeze swung the boughs of the
locust, now heavily draped with blossoms;
and soon his eyes began to follow what looked
like a flame darting in and out amid the snowy
cascades of bloom&mdash;a flame that was vocal
and that dropped down upon his ear crimson
petals of song&mdash;the Baltimore oriole.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
He liked all birds but three; and presently
one of those that he disliked appeared in a fork
of a locust and darted at the oriole, driving it
away and then returning to the fork&mdash;the blue-jay.
His hatred of this bird dated from the
time when one of the negroes had told him
that no blue-jays could be seen at twelve
o&#39;clock on Friday&mdash;all having gone to carry
brimstone to the lower regions. After that he
and Fred Ousley had made a point of trying
to kill jays early Friday morning: a fatally
shied stone would cut off to a dead certainty
just so much of that supply of brimstone. He
hated them even more on Saturday, when he
thought of them as having returned. The one
in the fork now was looking down at him, and,
with a great mockery of bowing, called out his
<i>Fiddle-Fiddle-Fiddle</i>: it was his way of saying:
&quot;You&#39;ll get there: and there will be brimstone,
sonny!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Of course he believed none of this legend;
but suggestions live on in the mind even though
they do not root themselves in faith; and
memory also has its power to make us like and
dislike. Presently, as he lay there stretched on
the grass and near the edge of the shade, another
ill-omened bird came sailing cloud-high across
the blue firmament; and having taken notice of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
him,&mdash;a motionless form on the earth below,&mdash;it
turned back and began to circle about him.
That was another bird he hated. When a child
he asked about it, and had been told that it
removed all disagreeable things from the farms.
He thought it a very kind, very self-sacrificing
and industrious bird to do so. And he conceived
the whole species of them as a procession of wheelbarrows
operated across the sky by means of
wings and tails. Afterwards, when his views
grew less hazy on natural history, he lowered
his opinion of the disinterested buzzard.</p>

<p class="indent">The third bird on which had fallen his resentment
was the rain-crow: earlier in his childhood
it had been told him that when the clacking wail
of this songster was heard on the stillness of a
summer day, a storm was coming. And he had
seen storms enough on that very farm&mdash;tornadoes
that cut a path through the woods as a
reaper cuts his way across the wheat-field.
But he saw no rain-crow to-day; you look for
them in August when they haunt the cool shade-trees
of lawns.</p>

<p class="indent">Altogether these three birds made with one
another a rather formidable combination for a
boy living on a farm: the one brought on storms
that threatened life; the second gladly presided
at your obsequies, if the opportunity were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
given; and the third was pleased to accompany
you to the infernal regions with the necessary
fuel. The arrangement seemed about perfect;
apparently they had overlooked nothing of value.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus he had not escaped that vast romance of
Nature which brooded more thickly over Kentucky
country life in those days than now: a
romance of superstitions and legends about bird
life and animal life and tree life, that extended
even to Nature&#39;s chemicals; for was there not
brimstone with its story? As far back as he
could remember he had been made familiar with
the idea&mdash;rather terrible in its way&mdash;that
there was a variety of Biblical horse which
breathed brimstone. All alone one day he
had made a somewhat cautious personal examination
of the paddocks and stalls; and was
relieved to discover that his uncle&#39;s horses
breathed out only what they breathed in&mdash;Kentucky
air. He felt glad that they were not
of the breed of those Biblical chargers.</p>

<p class="indent">But then there was brimstone in reserve for
a large portion of the human family; and with
a perverse mocking deviltry he pushed his inquiry
in this direction still farther. Without the
knowledge of any one he had wasted at a drugstore
in town his brightest dime for a package
of the avenging substance; and at home the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
following day he had scraped chips together
at the woodpile and started a blaze and poured
the brimstone in. Actually he had a sample of
hell fire in operation there behind the woodpile!
There was no question that brimstone knew
how to burn: it seemed well adapted for its
purpose. He did not take Fred Ousley into his
confidence in this experiment: the possibilities
were a little too personal even for friendship!</p>

<p class="indent">All this reveals a trait in him which lay deeper
than child&#39;s-play&mdash;a susceptibility to suggestion.
Even while he amused himself as a child with
the shams and superstitions about nature, these
lived on in his mind as part of its furnishings.
Alas, that this should be true for all of us&mdash;that
we cannot forget the things we do not believe in.
To the end of our lives our thoughts have to
move amid the obstructions and rubbish of the
useless and the laughable. The salon of our
inner dwelling is largely filled with old furniture
which we decline to sit in, but are obliged to
look at, and are powerless to remove; and which
fills the favorite recesses where we should like
to arrange the new.</p>

<p class="indent">There they were, then, that Saturday afternoon:
the uncle with his newspaper and the
nephew at that moment with his group of evil
birds.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
There was an interruption. Around the yard
with its velvet turf and blooming shrubs and
vines and flowers, that filled the air with fragrance,
was a plank fence newly whitewashed.
All the fences of the farm had been newly whitewashed;
and they ran hither and thither across
the emerald of the landscape like structures of
white marble. Through the gate of the yard
fence which was heard to shut behind him there
now advanced toward uncle and nephew a
neighbor of theirs, the minister of the country
church, himself a bluegrass farmer. He was one
of the many who liked to seek the company of
the untroubled turfman. The two were good
neighbors and great friends. The minister came
oftenest for a visit on Saturday afternoons, as if
he wished to touch at this harbor of a quiet life
while passing from the earthly fields of the week
to the Sabbath&#39;s holy land.</p>

<p class="indent">At the sound of the latch the uncle lifted his
eyes from his newspaper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bring a chair, Downs, will you?&quot; he said
in a cordial undertone; and soon there was a
fine group of rural humanity under the blossoming
locusts: the two men talking, and the boy,
now that his turn had come at last, lying on the
grass absorbed in the newspaper.</p>

<p class="indent">The men were characters of broad plain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
speech, much like English squires of two centuries
earlier:  not ladylike men:  Chaucer might
have been pleased to make one of their group
and listen, and turn them afterwards into fine
old English tales; Hogarth might have craved
the privilege to sit near and observe and paint;
and a certain Sir John Falstaff might have been
at home with them&mdash;in the absence of the
&quot;Merry Wives.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was another interruption. Around
the corner of the manor house a young servant
advanced, bearing a waiter with two deep
glasses well filled: at the bottom the drink was
golden; it was green and snow-white at the top:
a little view of icebergs with pine trees growing
on them.</p>

<p class="indent">The servant smiled and approached with
embarrassment, having discovered a guest; and
in a lowered tone she offered to the master
of the house apologies for not bringing three.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is yours, Aleck,&quot; said the host, holding
out one glass to the minister. &quot;This is for
you, Downs. Now, Melissa, make me one, will
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;None for me,&quot; said the minister.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then never mind, Melissa. But wait&mdash;lemonade?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; lemonade. It is the very thing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
&quot;As it is or as it might be?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As it is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lemonade without the decanter, Melissa.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">While the servant was in the house, the uncle
and the nephew waited with their glasses
untouched.</p>

<p class="indent">The turfman was very happy&mdash;happy in
his guest, in his nephew, in himself, in everything:
his mind overflowed with his quaint
playfulness; and when he talked, you were
loath to interrupt him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aleck,&quot; he said, rattling the ice in his
julep, &quot;don&#39;t you suppose that when we get
to heaven, nothing will make us happier there
than remembering the good times we had
in this world? so if you want to be happy
there, be happy here. <i>This</i> is one of the
pleasures that I expect to carry in memory
if I am ever transformed into a male seraph.
But I may not have to remember. If there is
any provision made for the thirst of the Kentucky
redeemed, do you know what I think will be the
reward of all central Kentucky male angels?
From under the great white throne there will
trickle an ice-cold stream of this, ready-made&mdash;and
I shouldn&#39;t wonder if there were a Kentuckian
under the throne making it. The Kentucky
delegation would be camped somewhere near,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
though there will be two delegations, of course,
because they will divide on politics. And don&#39;t
you fear that there will not be others hastening
to the banks of that stream! It is too late to
look for young Moses in the bulrushes; but I
shouldn&#39;t wonder if the whole ransomed universe
discovered old Moses in the mint.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Which mint?</i>&quot; said the minister, who kept
his worldly wits about him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aleck,&quot; replied the turfman, &quot;I leave it to
you whether that is not too flippant a remark
with which to close a gentleman&#39;s solemn
discourse.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The lemonade was served.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is yours sour enough, Aleck?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The visitor found it to his taste.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is yours sweet enough, Downs?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This hurt Downs&#39; feelings: it implied that he
was not old enough to like things sour. He
replied surlily that his might have been stronger.</p>

<p class="indent">The servant, watching from inside a window,
judged by the angle at which the glasses
were tilted that they were empty: she returned
and asked whether she should bring &#39;one
more all around.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;More lemonade, Aleck?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you, no more for me&mdash;but it was
good, better than yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
&quot;Another for you, Downs?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Downs thought that he would not have
another just for the moment: the servant
disappeared.</p>

<p class="indent">The nephew returned to his paper. The
turfman took from the turf a piece of whittling
wood, split it, and handed the larger piece to
the minister. The minister produced his penknife
and began to whittle. In those days a
countryman who did not carry his penknife
with a big blade well sharpened for whittling
as he talked with his neighbor stood outside
the manners and customs of a simple cheerful
land. And now the two friends were ready to
enjoy their afternoon&mdash;the vicar of souls and
the vicar of the stables.</p>

<p class="indent">The minister began to speak of his troubles&mdash;with
that strange leaning we all have to let our
confidences fall upon people who are not too
good: the vicar of the stables was not too
good to be sympathetic. It was all summed
up in one sentence&mdash;discouragement about his
growing boys. From the beginnings of their
lives he had tried to teach them the things
they were not to do; and all their lives they
had seemed bent on doing those things. He
felt disheartened as the boys grew older and
their waywardness increased. <i>What not to do</i>&mdash;morning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
and night <i>what not to do</i>. Yet
they were always doing it.</p>

<p class="indent">Out under the trees the peaceful happy sounds
of summer life in the yard came to the ears of the
minister as nature&#39;s chorus of happiness and
indifference. The breeder of thoroughbreds, as
his friend grew silent, laughed with his peaceful
nature, and remarked with respect and gentleness:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never train my colts in that way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My sons are not colts,&quot; said the minister,
laughing. &quot;Nor young jackasses!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I know they are not colts; but I doubt
whether their difference makes any difference
in the training of the two species of animal.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After a pause which was filled with little
sounds made by the industrious penknives,
the master of the stables went into the matter
for the pleasure of it:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You tell me that you have tried a method of
training and that it is a failure. I don&#39;t wonder:
any training would be a failure that made it the
chief business in life of any creature&mdash;human
or brute&mdash;to fix its mind upon what it is <i>not</i>
to do. You say you are always warning your
boys; that you fill their minds with cautions;
that you arouse their imagination with pictures
of forbidden things; make them look at life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
as a check, a halter, a blind bridle. So far as
I can discover, you have prepared a list of the
evil traits of humanity and required your boys
to memorize these: and then you tell them
to beware. Is that it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is exactly it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The youth lying on the grass laid aside his
newspaper and began to listen. The two men
welcomed his attention. The minister always
found it difficult to speak without a congregation&mdash;part
of which must be sinners: here
was an occasion for outdoor preaching. The
turfman probably welcomed this chance to
get before the youth in an indirect way certain
suggestions which he relied upon for his:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, that is where your training and my
training differ,&quot; he resumed. &quot;I never assemble
my colts at the barn door&mdash;that is, I would
not if I could&mdash;and recite to them the vicious
traits of the wild horse and require them to
memorize those traits and think about them
unceasingly, but never to imitate them. Speaking
of jacks, Aleck, you know our neighbor
stands a jack. And he would not if he could
compel his jack to make a study of the peculiarities
of Balaam&#39;s ass. But you compel your
boys to make a study of Balaam and his tribes.
You teach them the failings of mankind as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>
revealed themselves in an age of primitive
transgression. I say I never try to train a
horse that way. On the contrary I try to let
all the ancestral memories slumber, and I take
all the ancestral powers and develop them for
modern uses. Why, listen. We know that a
horse&#39;s teeth were once useful as a weapon to
bite its enemies. Now I try to give it the
notion that its teeth are only useful in feeding.
You know that its hoofs were used to strike its
enemies: it stood on its forefeet and kicked in
the rear; it stood on its hind feet and pawed
in front. You know that the horse is timid, it
is born timid, dies timid; but had it not been
timid, it would have been exterminated: its
speed was one of its means of survival: if it
could not conquer, it had to flee and the sentinel
of its safety was its fear; it was the most
valuable trait it had; this ancestral trait has not
yet been outlived; don&#39;t despise the horse for it.
But now I try to teach a horse that feet and legs
and speed are to serve another instinct&mdash;the
instinct to win in the new maddened courage
of the race-course. And I never allow the horse
to believe that it has such a thing as an enemy.
He is not to fear life, but to trust life. I teach
him that man is not his old hereditary enemy,
but his friend&mdash;and his master. I would not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
suggest to a horse any of its latent bad traits.
I never prohibit its doing anything. I never try
to teach it what not to do, but only what to do.
And so I have good colts, and you have&mdash;but
excuse me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The minister stood up and brushed the shavings
from his lap and legs; then as he took his
seat he covered his side of the discussion with
one breath:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hold to the old teaching&mdash;good from the
foundation of the world&mdash;that the old must tell
the young what not to do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aleck,&quot; replied the vicar of the stables
with his quaint sunniness, &quot;don&#39;t you know that
no human being can teach any living thing&mdash;man
or beast or bird or fish or flea&mdash;<i>not</i> to do a
thing? you can only teach <i>to do</i>. If there is a
God of this universe, He is a God of doing.
You can no more teach &#39;a not&#39; than you can
teach &#39;a nothing.&#39; Now try to teach one of
your sons nothing! This world has never taught,
and will never teach, a prohibition, because a
prohibition is a nothing; it has never taught
anything but the will and desire to do: that is
the root of the matter. Do you suppose I try
to keep one of my cows from kicking over the
bucket of milk by tying her hind legs? I go to
the other end of the beast and do something for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
her brain so that when she feels the instinct to
kick which is her right, what I have taught her
will compel her to waive her right and to keep her
feet on the ground. That is all there is of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They were hearty and good-humored in their
talk, and the minister did not budge: but the
boy listened only to his uncle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you remember, Aleck, when you and I
were in the school over yonder and one morning
old Bowles issued a new order that none of us
boys was to ask for a drink between little recess
and big recess? Now none of us drank at that
hour; but the day after the order was issued,
every boy wanted a drink, and demanded a
drink, and got a drink. It was thirst for principle.
Every boy knew it was his right to
drink whenever he was thirsty&mdash;and even when
he was not thirsty; and he disobeyed orders
to assert that right. And if old Bowles
had not lowered his authority before that
advancing right, there would not have been
any old Bowles. There is one thing greater
than any man&#39;s authority, and that is any
man&#39;s right. Isn&#39;t that the United States?
Wasn&#39;t that Kentucky country school-house
the United States? And don&#39;t you know,
Aleck, that as soon as a thing is forbidden,
human nature investigates the command to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
see whether it puts forth an infringement of its
liberties? Don&#39;t you <i>know</i>, Aleck, that the
disobedience of children may be one of their
natural rights?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At this point the uncle turned unexpectedly
toward his nephew:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does this bore you, Downs?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Downs remarked pointedly that half of it
bored him: he made it perfectly clear which
was the objectionable half.</p>

<p class="indent">The uncle did not notice the discourtesy to his
guest, but continued his amiable observation:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To me it all leads up to this&mdash;and now the
road turns away from colts to the road you and I
walk in as men. It leads up to this: the difference
between failure and transgression. Command
to do; and the worst result can only be
failure. Command not to do; and the worst
result is transgression. Now we all live on
partial failure: it is the beginning of effort and
the incentive to effort. We try and fail; with
more will and strength and experience we wipe
out the failure and stand beyond it. Long
afterwards men look back and laugh at their
failures, love them because they are the measure
of what they were and of what they have
become. It is our life, the glory of more
strength, the triumph of will and determination.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
It is the crowning victory of the world. And it
is the road that leads upward.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But transgression! No transgression ever
develops life; it is so much death. You can&#39;t
wrest victory out of transgression: it&#39;s a thing
by itself&mdash;a final defeat. And what has been
defeated is your last safeguard&mdash;your will.
Every transgression helps to kill the will. It
weakens, discourages, humiliates, stings, poisons.
The road of transgression is downward.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He stood up, and his guest with him. As he
lifted his alpaca coat from the grass and put it
on, there was left lying his bowie-knife, and he
put that on. It was the bowie-knife age.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you come with us, Downs?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Downs thought he would now read the newspaper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where is Fred Ousley?&quot; asked the minister of
him, knowing that the two boys were inseparable.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He has gone to a picnic.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why didn&#39;t you go to the picnic?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wasn&#39;t invited: it&#39;s his cousins&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And haven&#39;t you any cousins who give picnics?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t like my cousins: I hate my cousins:
Fred hates <i>his</i> cousins: it&#39;s a girl that goes <i>with</i>
his cousins.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what about a girl with your cousins?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
&quot;Well, while you&#39;re talking, what about your
sons and their cousins? We&#39;re running this
farm very well, and we&#39;re all pleased. From
what I have been hearing, it&#39;s more than can be
said about yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The minister laughed good-naturedly at this
rudeness as the two friends walked away; but
the vicar of the stables observed mildly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You gave him the wrong kind of suggestion,
Aleck. It wasn&#39;t in your words exactly; I don&#39;t
know where it was; but I felt it and he felt it:
somehow you challenged him to employ his
manly art of self-defence; and part of that art
is to attack. But never mind about Downs.
Now come to the stable: I am going to show you
a young thoroughbred there that has never had a
disagreeable suggestion made to him: he thinks
this farm paradise. And the five great things
I tried to teach him are: to develop his will, to
develop his speed, to develop his endurance and
perseverance, to develop his pride, and to
develop his affection: he is a masterpiece.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">In the green yard that summer afternoon,
under the white locust blossoms and with the
fragrance of rose and honeysuckle and lilac all
about him, the youth lay on the grass beside
the newspaper&mdash;which he forgot. A new world
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
of thinking had been disclosed to him. And
he made one special discovery: that as far as
memory could reach his uncle had never told
him not to do anything: always it had been to
do&mdash;never not to do.</p>

<p class="indent">And he was a good deal impressed with the
difference between failure and transgression.
He did not at all like that idea of transgression;
but he thought he should like to try failure for
a while; then he could call on more strength,
tighten his will, develop more fighting power.
He rather welcomed that combat with failure
which would end in success.</p>

<p class="indent">He wished Fred were there. It was Saturday
he came to stay all night; and the two were
getting old enough to talk about their futures
and at what ages each would marry. They
described the desirable type of woman; and
sometimes exchanged descriptions.</p>

<p class="indent">And then suddenly he rolled over the grass convulsed
with laughter: his uncle was raising him as
a thoroughbred colt. He approved of the training,
but somehow he did not feel complimented by
the classification. Fred would have to hear that&mdash;that
he was being trained as for a race-course.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The next morning he was sitting in church;
and the minister read the Commandments.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
Hitherto he had always listened to them as
the whole congregation apparently listened: as
to a noise from the pulpit that drew near, lasted
for a while, and then rumbled on&mdash;without being
meant for any one. But this morning he scrutinized
each Commandment with new thoughtfulness&mdash;and
with a new resentfulness also; and
when a certain one was reached he made a
discovery that it applied to men only: &quot;Thou
shalt not covet thy neighbor&#39;s wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Why should not wives be commanded not to
covet their neighbors&#39; husbands? he wondered.
Why was the other half of the Commandment
suppressed? Moses must have been a very
polite man! Perhaps there was more involved
than courtesy: otherwise he might have found
life more tolerable among the Egyptians: he
might have been forced to make the return trip
across the Red Sea when the waters were inconveniently
deep. Those Jewesses of the Wandering
might have seen to it that he was not to
have the pleasure of dying so mysteriously on
Nebo&#39;s lonely mountain: his sepulchre would
have been marked&mdash;and well marked.</p>

<p class="indent">He sat there in the corner of the church, and
plied his insolent satire. Fred Ousley must hear
about the second discovery also&mdash;the Commandment
for men only.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span></p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Then three years passed and he was eighteen;
and from fifteen to eighteen is a long time in
youth&#39;s life; things are much worse or things
are much better.</p>

<p class="indent">It was one rainy September night after supper,
and he and his uncle were sitting on opposite
sides of the deep fireplace.</p>

<p class="indent">Some logs blazed comfortably, and awoke in
both man and youth the thoughtfulness which
lays such a silence upon us with the kindling
of the earliest Autumn fires. Talk between
them was never forced. It came, it went: they
were at perfect ease with one another in their
comradeship. The man&#39;s long thoughts went
backward; the youth&#39;s long thoughts went forward.
The man was smoking, at intervals
serenely drawing his amber-hued meerschaum
from under his thick mustache. The youth
was not smoking&mdash;he was waiting to be a man.
Once his uncle had remarked: &quot;Tobacco is
for men if they wish tobacco, and for pioneer old
ladies if they must have their pipes. Begin to
smoke after you are a man, Downs. Cigars for
boys are as bad as cigars would be for old ladies.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The way in which this had been put rather
captured the youth&#39;s fancy: he was determined
to have every inward and outward sign of being
a man: now he was waiting for the cigar.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
He had been hunting with Fred Ousley that
afternoon, and just before dark had come in
with a good bag of birds. A drizzle of rain had
overtaken him in the fields and dampened his
clothing. The truth is that he and Ousley had
lingered over their good-by; Fred was off for
college. Supper was over when he reached the
house, and he had merely washed his hands and
gone in to supper as he was, eating alone; and
now as he sat gazing into the fire, his boots and
his hunting-trousers and his dark blue flannel
shirt began to steam. He was too much a
youth to mind wet garments.</p>

<p class="indent">The man on the opposite side sent secret
glances across at him: they were full of pride,
of a man&#39;s idolatry of a scion of his own blood.
He was thinking of the blood of that family&mdash;blood
never to be forced or hurried: death
rather than being commanded: rage at being
ordered: mingled of Scotch and Irish and Anglo-Saxon&mdash;with
the Kentucky wildness and insolence
added. Blood that often wallowed in the
old mires of humanity; then later in life by a
process of unfolding began to set its course
toward the virtues of the world and ultimately
stood where it filled lower men with awe.</p>

<p class="indent">September was the month for the opening of
schools and colleges. The boy&#39;s education had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
been difficult and desultory. First he had gone
to the neighborhood school, then to a boys&#39;
select school, then to a military school, then to
a college. Usually he quit and came home. Once
he had joined his uncle in another State at the
Autumn meeting of a racing association&mdash;had
merely walked up to him on the grounds, eating
purple grapes out of a paper bag and with
his linen trousers pockets bulging with ripe
peaches.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Downs,&quot; his uncle observed by way of
greeting him, as though he had reappeared round
a corner.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who won the last race?&quot; inquired the boy as
though he had been absent ten minutes.</p>

<p class="indent">Now out of the silence of the rainy September
night and out of the thoughtfulness of the fire,
the imperious splendid dark glowing young
animal steaming in his boots and flannel suddenly
looked across and spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I am ever going to do anything, it is about
time I began.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The philosopher on the other side of the fire
grew wary; he had given the blood time, and
now the blood was mounting to the brain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is time, if you think it is time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One thing I am not going to do,&quot; said the
arbiter of his fate, as if he were drawing a surprise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
from the depths of his nature and were
offering it to his uncle; if possible, without
discourtesy, but certainly without discussion&mdash;&quot;one
thing I am not going to do; I am not
going to breed horses.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The fire crackled, and no other sound disturbed
the stillness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some one else will breed them,&quot; replied the
vicar of the stables, with quietness: the sun
always seemed to remain on his face after it had
gone down. &quot;They will be bred by some one
else. The breeding of horses in the world will
not be stopped because some one does not wish
to breed them. It will come to the same thing
in the end. Even if it does not come to the
same thing, it will come to something different.
No matter, either way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The young hunter had unbuttoned one of his
shirt sleeves and bared his arm above the elbow;
and he now stroked his forearm as he bent it
backward over the biceps and suddenly struck
out at the air as though he would knock the head
off of an idea.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My notion is this: I don&#39;t want to stand
still and let my horse do the running. If I have
a horse, I want it to stand still and let me do
the running. If there is any excitement for
either of us, I want the excitement. I don&#39;t care
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
<i>to own</i> an animal that wins a race: I want
<i>to be</i> the animal that wins a race.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then be the animal that wins the race!
The horse will win his races: he will take care
of himself: win your race.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I intend to win my race.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was silence for a while.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As it is not to be horses, then, I have been
thinking of other things I might do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Keep on thinking.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You might help me to think.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am ready to think with you; you can only
think for yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What about going into the army?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You just said you wanted excitement.
There is no excitement in the army unless there is
war. We have just passed through one war, and
I don&#39;t think either of us will live to see another.
Still, if you wish, I can get you to West Point.
Or, if you prefer the navy, I can get you to
Annapolis.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No Annapolis for me! I wouldn&#39;t live on
anything that I couldn&#39;t walk about on and sit
down on and roll over on. No water for me.
I&#39;ll take land all round me in every direction.
I guess I&#39;ll leave the sea to the Apostle Peter.
Life on land and death on land for me. Hard
showers and streams and ponds and springs&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
will do for water. No Annapolis, thank
you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;West Point, then.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I went into the army, wouldn&#39;t I have to
leave the farm here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;d have to leave the farm here unless
the Government would quarter some troops here
for your accommodation. In case of war, you
might arrange with the enemy to come to
Kentucky and attack you where you would be
comfortable.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The future officer of his country did not smile
at this: his manner seemed to indicate that such
a concession might not be so absurd. He did
not budge from his position:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;d rather do something that would let me
live here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You could live here and study law: some of
the greatest members of the Kentucky bar have
been farmers. You could live here and practise
law in the country seat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Suppose I studied law and then some day I
were called to the Supreme Bench: wouldn&#39;t
that take me away?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It might take you away unless the Supreme
Court would get down from its Bench and come
and sit on your bench&mdash;always to accommodate
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
&quot;I don&#39;t know about law: I&#39;ll have to think:
law <i>does</i> make you think!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is the pulpit: some of the greatest
Kentucky divines have been bluegrass farmers&mdash;though
I&#39;ve always wished that they wouldn&#39;t
call themselves divines. It&#39;s more than Christ
did!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The pulpit! And then all my life I&#39;d be
thinking of other people&#39;s faults and failings.
A fine time I&#39;d have, trying to chase my friends
to hell.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The next suggestion followed in due order.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s Oratory; some of the great Kentucky
orators have been bluegrass farmers.
There is Southern Oratory.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oratory&mdash;where would I get my gas?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Manufacture it. It always has to be
manufactured. The consumer always manufactures.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I went in for oratory, you <i>know</i> I&#39;d come
out in Congress; you know they always do:
then no farm for me again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is, unless&mdash;you know, Congress might
adjourn and hold its sessions&mdash;that same idea&mdash;to
accommodate you&mdash;!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;d like to be a soldier and I&#39;d like to be a
farmer, if I could get the two professions together.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
&quot;They went together regularly in pioneer
Kentucky. The soldiers were farmers and the
farmers were soldiers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And then if I could be a doctor. That&#39;s
what I&#39;d like best. To be a soldier and a farmer
and a doctor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Men were all three in pioneer Kentucky.
During the period of Indian wars the Kentucky
farmer and soldier, who was the border scout,
was also sometimes the scout of Æsculapius.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Æsculapius&mdash;who was he? Trotter, runner,
or pacer?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He set the pace: you might call him a
pacer.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">What a sense of deep peace and security and
privacy there was in the two being thus free to
talk together of life and the world&mdash;in that
womanless house! No woman sitting beside
the fire to interject herself and pull things her
way; or to sit by without a sign&mdash;and pull
things her way afterwards&mdash;without a sign.</p>

<p class="indent">The physical comfort of the night, and the
rain, and the snug hearth awoke a desire for
more confidences.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me about the medical schools when you
were a student. Not about the professors. I
don&#39;t want to hear anything about the professors.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
You wouldn&#39;t know anything about
<i>them</i>, anyhow: no student ever does. But what
were the students up to among themselves at
nights? The wild ones. I don&#39;t want to hear
anything about the goody-goody ones. Tell me
about the devils&mdash;the worst of the devils.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The medical schools of those days, as members
of the profession yet living can testify if they
would, had their stories of student life that
make good stories when recited around the
fireside with September rain on the roof. The
former graduate and non-practitioner was not
averse seemingly to reminiscence. Forthwith he
entered upon some chronicles and pursued them
with that soft, level voice of either betting with
you or baptizing you&mdash;the voice of gambling
in this world or of gambling for the next.</p>

<p class="indent">As the recitals wound along their channels,
the listener&#39;s enthusiasm became stirred: by
degrees it took on a kindling that was like a wild
leaping flame of joy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But there always has to be a leader,&quot; he
said, as though forecasting for himself a place
of such splendid prominence. &quot;There has to be
a leader, a head.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was the head.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The young hunter on the opposite side of the
fireplace suddenly threw up his arms and rolled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
out of his chair and lay on the floor as though he
had received a charge of buckshot in one ear.
At last, gathering himself up on the floor, he
gazed at the tranquil amber pipe and tranquil
piper:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>You!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a mild wave of the hand by the
historian of the night, much as one puts aside a
faded wreath, deprecating being crowned with it
a second time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Another shock like that&mdash;&mdash;!&quot; and the
searcher for a profession climbed with difficulty
into his chair again. For a while there was
satisfied silence, and now things took on a graver
character:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Somehow I feel,&quot; said the younger of the
men, &quot;that there have been great men all about
here. I don&#39;t see any now; but I have a feeling
that they have been here&mdash;great men. I
feel them behind me&mdash;all kinds of great men.
It is like the licks where we now find the footprints
and the bones of big game, larger animals
that have vanished. There are the bones of
greater men in Kentucky: I feel their lives
behind me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They <i>are</i> behind you: the earth is rank
with them. You need not look anywhere else
for examples. I don&#39;t know how far you got in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
your Homer at school before you were tired of
it; but there is the <i>Iliad</i> of Kentucky: I am
glad you have begun to read <i>that</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The rain on the shingles and in the gutters
began to sound like music. The two men alone
there in their talk about life, not a woman near,
a kind of ragged sublimity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To be a soldier and to be a farmer&mdash;if I could
get those two professions together,&quot; persisted the
youth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In times of peace there is only one profession
that furnishes the active soldier: and that is the
profession of medicine. It is the physician and
the surgeon that the military virtues rest on;
and the martial traits when there is no war. It
is these men that bring those virtues and those
traits undiminished from one war to the next
war. There is no kind of manhood in the
soldier, the fighting man, that is not in the fighting
physician and fighting surgeon&mdash;fighting
against disease. There is nothing that has to be
changed in these two when war breaks out or
when peace comes: their constant service fits
them for either. In times of peace the only
warlike type of man actively engaged in human
life is the doctor and surgeon. Did you ever
think of that?&quot; said the older man, persuasively.</p>

<p class="indent">The silence in the room grew deeper.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
&quot;Tell me about the professions in the War:
what did they do about it; how did they act?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The professions divided: some going with
North, some going with South; fighting on each
side, fighting one another. The ministry dividing
most bitterly and sending up their prayers
on each side for the destruction of the other&mdash;to
the same God. All except one: the profession of
medicine remained indivisible. For that is the
profession which has but a single ideal, a single
duty, a single work, and but one patient&mdash;Man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The silence had become too deep for words.</p>

<p class="indent">The young hunter quietly got up and lit his
candle and squared himself in the middle of the
floor, pale with the sacred fire of a youth&#39;s ideal.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am going to be a Kentucky country doctor.
Good night!&quot; He strode heavily out of the
room, and his stride on the stairway sounded
like an upward march toward future glory.</p>

<p class="indent">The man at the fire listened. Usually when
the youth had reached his room above and set
his candle on his stand beside his bed, he undressed
there as with one double motion of
shucking an ear of corn: half to right and half
to left; and then the ear stood forth bared in its
glistening whiteness and rounded out to perfect
form with clean vitality. But now for a long
time he heard a walking back and forth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
a solemn tread: life&#39;s march had begun in
earnest.</p>

<p class="indent">He rose from his chair and tapped the ash out
of his meerschaum. Through force of habit and
old association with the race-course he looked at
his timepiece.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I win that race in good time,&quot; he said.
&quot;That colt was hard to manage, obstreperous
and balky.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It had always been his secret wish that his
nephew would enter the profession that he himself
had spurned. Perhaps no man ever ceases
to have some fondness for the profession he has
declined, as perhaps a woman will to the last
send some kind thoughts toward the man she
has rejected.</p>

<p class="indent">After winning a race, he always poured out a
libation; and he went to his sideboard now and
poured out a libation sixteen years old.</p>

<p class="indent">And he did not pour it on the ground.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">And now eight years followed, during which
the youth Downs Birney became young Dr.
Birney&mdash;a very great stage of actual progress.
Seven away from Kentucky, and one there
since his return. Of those seven, five in New
York for a degree; and two in Europe&mdash;in
Berlin, in Vienna&mdash;for more lectures, more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
hospital work, another degree. At the end of
the second he returned incredibly developed to
Kentucky, to the manor house and the stock
farm; and to the uncle to whom these years had
furnished abundance of means whereby to get
the best of all that was wisely to be gotten:
an affectionate abundance, no overfond super-abundance,
no sentimentality: merely a quiet
Kentucky sun throwing the energy of its rays
along that young life-track&mdash;hanging out a
purse of gold at each quarter-stretch, to be
snatched as the thoroughbred passed.</p>

<p class="indent">A return home then to a neighborhood of
kinships and friendships and to the uphill work
which could so easily become downhill sliding&mdash;the
practice of medicine among a people
where during these absences he had been remembered,
if remembered at all, as the wildest
youth in the country. When it had been
learned what profession he had chosen, the prediction
had been made that within a year
Downs would reduce the mortality of the
neighborhood to normal&mdash;one to every inhabitant!</p>

<p class="indent">But at the end of this first year of undertaking
to convert ridicule into acceptance of
himself as a stable health officer and confidential
health guardian, he was able to say that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
he had made a good start: neighbors have
long memories about a budding physician&#39;s first
cases&mdash;when he fails. Young Dr. Birney had
not failed, because none of his cases had been
important: when there was danger, it was
considered safe to avoid the doctor: the only
way in which he could have lost a patient
would have been to murder one! Thus he
had entered auspiciously upon the long art and
science of securing patients. But he had secured
no wife! And he greatly preferred one impossible
wife to all possible patients. That problem
meantime had been pressing him sorely.</p>

<p class="indent">The womanless house in which he had been
reared and his boyhood on a stock farm had
rendered him rather shy of girls and kept him
much apart from the society of the neighborhood.
Nevertheless even in Europe before his
return&mdash;with the certainty of marriage before
him&mdash;he had recalled two or three juvenile perturbations,
and he had resolved upon arrival to
follow these clues and ascertain what changes
seven years had wrought in them. There was
no difficulty in following the clues a few weeks
after getting back to Kentucky: they led in
each case to the door of a growing young family:
and out of these households he thereupon began
to receive calls for his services to sick children:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
all the perturbations had become volcanoes,
and were now on their way to become extinct
craters.</p>

<p class="indent">So he was clueless. He must make his own
clues and then follow. Nor could there be any
dallying, since he could not hope to succeed in
his profession as a young unmarried physician:
thus pressure from without equalled pressure
from within.</p>

<p class="indent">Moreover, he was pleasantly conscious of
a general commotion of part of the population
toward him with reference to life&#39;s romance.
The girls of that race and land were much too
healthy and normally imaginative not to feel
the impact of the arrival of a young doctor&mdash;who
was going to ask one of them to marry him.
As to those seven years of his in New York and
Europe, he could discover only one mind in
them: they deplored his absence not because
they had missed <i>him</i>, but because he had missed
<i>them</i>: it was no gain to have been in New York
and Berlin and Vienna if you lost Kentucky!
He gradually acquired the feeling that if in
addition to the misfortune of having been absent
for several years, the calamity had been
his of having been born abroad, it would not
have been permitted him to plough corn.</p>

<p class="indent">But while they could not abet him in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
error of thinking that he had returned a cosmopolitan,
bringing high prestige, instantly
they showed general excitement that he&mdash;one
of themselves&mdash;was at home again in search
of a wife. He had arrived like a starving bee
released in a ripe vineyard; and for a while
he could only whirl about, distracted by indecision
as to what cluster of grapes he should
settle on: not that the grapes did not have
something to say as to the privilege of alighting.
After the bee had selected the bunch, the
bunch selected the bee. A vineyard ripe to be
gathered&mdash;and being gathered! Every month
or so a vine disappeared&mdash;claimed for Love&#39;s
vintage&mdash;stored away in Love&#39;s cellar.</p>

<p class="indent">They were everywhere! As he drove widely
about the country, the two most abundant
characteristics seemed to be unequalled grass
and marriageable girls. He met them on turnpikes
and lanes&mdash;in leafy woods at picnics&mdash;at
moonlight dances&mdash;on velvet lawns&mdash;amid
the roses of old gardens&mdash;and he began humorously
to count those who looked available.
One passed him on the road one day, and, lifting
a corner of the buggy curtain, she peeped back
at him: &quot;She will do!&quot; he said. Another
swept past him on horseback and looked in the
opposite direction. &quot;She will do!&quot; he said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
He met two on a shady street of a quiet town under
their peach-blow parasols: &quot;They will do!&quot;
he said. He saw four on a lawn playing tennis,
and watched their vital abandon and tasted
their cup: &quot;They will do!&quot; he said. He swept
his eyes over a ball-room one night: &quot;They
will all do!&quot; he said, and made an end of
counting.</p>

<p class="indent">Into this world of romance and bride-seeking
the doctor launched himself formally under
brilliant auspices of earth and sky and people
one beautiful afternoon of early summer: it
was on the grounds of one of the finest old
country places at a lawn party with tennis
matches. It was his first appearance as a candidate
for life&#39;s greater game. A large gallery of
onlookers, seated along a trellis of vines and
roses, measured him critically as he stepped out
on the court: he knew it and he challenged the
criticism. In his white flannels; his big bared
head covered with curling black hair; his neck
half bare in its virile strength; his big grayish
blue eyes flashing with glorious health, full of
good humor and of deeper warmth; his big
half-bared arms strong to hold in love or to lift
in pain; the big stub nose of tenacity; the big
red mouth that laughing revealed the big thick
white teeth, good to tear and grind their way:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
his twenty-six years of native Kentucky insolence
capped with a consciousness of travel
and knowledge of his own authority and power&mdash;youthful
white soldier of the clean,&mdash;the
neighborhood&#39;s evangelist of life and death,&mdash;he
looked like a good partner for the afternoon
or for life. One girl, seeing all this&mdash;and
more&mdash;repeated to herself, she did not know
why, Blake&#39;s poem on the Tiger.</p>

<p class="indent">His partner that afternoon was his hostess&mdash;a
Kentucky girl just home from her Northern
college as a graduate. She too had been
away for several years; and they had this in
common as the first bond&mdash;that they had
arrived as comparative strangers and saw their
home surroundings from the outside: they
spoke of it: it introduced them.</p>

<p class="indent">There was tension in the play for this reason;
and for others: this first public appearance
with so much going on in imagination and
sympathy. Too great tension developed as the
battle of the racquets went on: so that the
doctor&#39;s partner, overreaching and twisting,
sprained an ankle, and the games ended for
them: she was assisted upstairs, and he applied
his skill and his treatment.</p>

<p class="indent">As he drove home he thought a good deal of
his partner: of her proud reserve toward him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
out of the game and of her inseparable blending
of herself with him in the game; her devotion
to their common cause; her will not that
she should win but that both should win; her
unruffled ignoring of a bad play of his or a bad
play of her own; the freshened energy of her
attack after a reverse; her matter-of-course
pleasure when he played well or when she
played well; the complete surrender of herself
to him for the game&mdash;after which instantly
there was nothing between them except the
courtesy of a hostess. He thought of these
traits. And then he recalled her fortitude during
the acute suffering with that twisted ankle!
How contemptuously she had borne pain!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That little foot,&quot; he said, moved to admiration,
&quot;that little foot makes the true footprint
of the greater vanished people! She is
of the blood of male and female heroes: she
knows how to do and she knows how to suffer!
Now if I fall in love with her&mdash;!&quot; and there
surged through him the invitation to do so.</p>

<p class="indent">But at the end of his first year the doctor
felt that he had made only a general advance
toward the long battle-line of Love; he had
reconnoitred, but he had not attacked; he had
a vast marital receptivity embracing many
square miles. He had slid his hands along the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
nuptial rope, but he could not as yet discover
who was waiting beside the bridal knot.</p>

<p class="indent">On the other hand, there were two or three
cases of wounded on the other side; and if one
could have been privileged to stand near, it
would have been possible to see Love&#39;s ambulances
secretly and mournfully moving here
and there to the rear. If as much as this
could not be said for him, what right would
he have had to be practising there&mdash;or to be
alive anywhere!</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">And now the winter of that first year had come:
it brought an immense stride&mdash;in Progress.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the twenty-fourth of December.
Darkness was beginning to fall on road and
woods and fields; and he was driving rapidly
home because he was tired and ravenous and
because he was thinking of his supper&mdash;always
that good Kentucky supper. But to-night he
would have to eat solitary because some days
previous his uncle had gone to New York&mdash;gone
in his quiet way: announcing the fact one
morning and stopping there&mdash;his reasons were
his own.</p>

<p class="indent">About a mile from home the doctor&#39;s horse,
rushing on through the gathering Christmas
twilight, began to overtake a vehicle moving at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
a stately pace as though its mission involved
affairs too elaborate for haste. As he approached
from the rear he recognized that it
was Frederick Ousley&#39;s carriage, returning from
his afternoon wedding several miles across the
country.</p>

<p class="indent">He had never met the girl that his friend was
to marry: her home was in another neighborhood,
and the demands of this first year upon
him had been too many. He had not even had
time to go to the wedding. Now he checked
his horse in order not to pass the carriage, and
at a respectful distance of a few yards constituted
himself its happy procession. At the front gate
it turned in and rolled through the woods to the
house, the windows of which were blazing with
candles&mdash;bridal lights and the lights of Christmas
Eve! He stopped at the gate and followed
the progress of it as it intercepted the lights now
of one window and now of another as it wound
along the drive. Leaning forward with his
forearms on his knees and peering from the
side-curtain, he saw the front doors thrown open,
or knew this by the flood of radiance that issued
from the hall; saw the young master of the
house walk to the top step of his porch and there
turn and wait to receive his bride&mdash;in true
poetic and royal and manly fashion: wishing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
her to come to him as he faced her on his
threshold; he saw arms outstretched toward
her, saw her mount falteringly and give her
hands; and saw them walk side by side into the
hall: the servants closed in upon them, the
doors closed upon the servants.</p>

<p class="indent">Christmas Eve&mdash;Night of Nativity&mdash;Home&mdash;Youth&mdash;Love&mdash;Firelight
and Darkness&mdash;One
another!</p>

<p class="indent">As the doctor watched, that vision sank into
him as an arrow which had been shot into the
air years before and had now hit its mark. He
straightened himself abruptly and gave the
rein to his horse with a feeling that the shaft
stuck in its wound. Then with a vigorous
shake of his head he said to himself:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dr. Birney, there is a young man in this
buggy who needs your best attention: see that
he gets it and gets it quickly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He found his supper awaiting him: and
some intelligence which drove appetite away
and drove him away, leaving the supper uneaten:
it was a letter from his uncle&mdash;one of
those tranquil letters:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They think they will have to perform an
operation on me, but I want your opinion first.
I trust your judgment beyond that of any of
them, old and experienced as they are: and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
should have sought your judgment before coming
away if I could have felt sure that it would
be needed: unless it were needed, I did not
wish you to know. You had better start without
losing very much time. They seem to regard
the case as urgent and uncertain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If anything should happen before you are
able to reach me, these few words will be my
last.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have long since entered, Downs, into
possession of part of what you will inherit
from me: and that is your acquaintance with
the imperfections of my character and the
frailties of my life. There has been much in it
that even a worse man might regret, but nothing
of which any better man could be ashamed.
You have always guarded this part of your
inheritance as your sacred private personal
property. My request is that you will hereafter
make as little account of it as possible;
I hope you will never be tempted to draw upon
it as a valuable fund; and as early as time
permits, put the memory of it away to gather
its oblivion and its dust.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will find that everything of value I
possess has been left to you. You think I
have loved horses; I have loved nothing but
you. I have loved you because you were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
worthy of it; but I should have loved you if
you had not been worthy. The horses meant
a good deal to me in life, but they mean nothing
in death.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I believe you will be one more great Kentucky
country doctor. And whatever race you
may have to run in this world, whether you
win or whether you lose, I know it will be a hard,
a gallant, struggle: that is all the thoroughbred
can ever do. Having delivered over to you
everything I own and retaining only the things
I cannot will away,&mdash;my judgment, my confidence
in you, and my devotion to you,&mdash;I
wager these that you will win life&#39;s race and
win it gloriously. My last bet&mdash;with my last
coin&mdash;you will win!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If this is good-by&mdash;good-by.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was several weeks before he returned,
bringing with him all that was earthly of one
whose races were over and who himself had just
been entered for the unknown stake of the Great
Futurity.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Now February had reappeared, and with it
came another stage of Progress. When he
entered the breakfast room one morning&mdash;always
to a hearty breakfast&mdash;he went first to
the windows and looked out at the low dark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>
clouds shrouding the sky and the rapidly
whitening earth: it was snowing heavily. As
he turned within, the bleakness out of doors
brightened the fire and added its comfort to the
breakfast table. While he was pouring out his
coffee, suddenly through one window an object
appeared; and looking out, he saw Frederick
Ousley on horseback at the foot of the pavement:
he was but half seen, laughing and
beckoning amid the thickly falling flakes.</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor rushed out to the porch, and young
Ousley spurred his horse up to the side of it,
riding over flower-beds, trampling and ruining
plants that happened not now to be in bloom.
The two friends after a long crushing grip poured
out their friendship with eye and speech, greeting
and laughter.</p>

<p class="indent">Two products of that land. With much in
sympathy, with no outward resemblance: one
of little mingled Anglo-Saxon blood: the other
of Scotch-Irish Anglo-Saxon strains which have
created so much history wherever they have
made their mortal fight. The young Kentucky
Anglo-Saxon on his horse, blond-haired, blue-eyed,
with heavy body and heavy limbs, a
superb animal to begin with, wheresoever and
in whatsoever the animal might end: the snow
on the edges of his yellowish hair and close-clipped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
beard; around his neck, just visible
inside his upturned coat collar, a light blue
scarf, a woman&#39;s scarf, tied there as he had
started by tender fingers that had perhaps
craved the mere touching of his flesh: the
scarf, as it were, of Lohengrin blue; for there
was something so knightly about him, he
radiated such a passion of clean young manhood,
that you all but thought of him as a
Kentucky Lohengrin&mdash;whom no Elsa had
questioned too closely, and for whom there
would never be a barren return to Montserrat.</p>

<p class="indent">Facing him, the young Kentucky Scotch-Irish
Anglo-Saxon, physical equal, physical
opposite: dark and swarthy soldier of the
South: as he stood there giving you no notion
that for him waited the crimson-dyed cup of
Life&#39;s tragic brew, topped at this moment with
the white dancing foam of youth and happiness.</p>

<p class="indent">They talked rapidly of many things. Then
the object of the visit was disclosed&mdash;with an
altered voice and manner:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As soon as you have had breakfast, Downs,
I wish you would come over. Mrs. Ousley is
not very well. She would like to see you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then he added with affectionate seriousness:
&quot;I have told her about you: how we have
known each other all our lives, have played
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
together, hunted together, slept together,
travelled together, studied together. She knows
all about you! I have prepared the way for
you to be her physician. There was a great
difficulty there&mdash;that question of her physician:
you will know <i>that</i>, when you know
<i>her</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A new look had come into his eyes: he
stood as on the peak of experience&mdash;the true
mountain-top of the life of this world.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will come at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Young Ousley, with a sudden impulse, perhaps
to conceal his own sacred emotion, rode
over to a window of the breakfast room and
peered in at the waiting table with its solitary
chair at the head. He raised his voice as
though speaking to an imaginary person inside:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you do, Mrs. Birney?&quot; he said.
&quot;Could I speak to the doctor a moment? I
should like to have his private ear professionally:
could you pass one of his ears out?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor stooped and scraped together a
snowball from the edge of the porch, and with
a soft toss hit him in the face:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take that for speaking to Mrs. Birney
through a window! And Mrs. Birney is not
my office boy. And I do the passing out of my
own ears&mdash;to any desired distance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span>
The young husband rode back to the porch,
wiping the snow out of his laughing eyes: they
looked blue as with the clear laughter of the sky.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That will never do!&quot; he said with a backward
motion of his head toward the solitary
chair at the breakfast-table. &quot;What right have
you to defraud a girl out of all that happiness?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not defrauding a girl out of all that
happiness: I am being defrauded. I am not
the culprit: I am the victim. As a consequence
of trying to save the lives of other husbands,
I have nearly come to my own death as a
bachelor: I have about succumbed to inanition:
I am a mere Hamlet of soliloquy&mdash;and abstention.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was the last playfulness of boyhood friendship,
of a return to old ways of jesting when
jesting meant nothing. But the glance into
the breakfast room&mdash;those rallying words&mdash;the
return of the snowball into the face&mdash;were
the ending of a past: each felt that this was
enough of it.</p>

<p class="indent">As young Ousley rode away, he wheeled his
horse at the distance of some yards and called
back formally:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Ousley would like to see you as soon
as you can come, doctor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was a professional command.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
&quot;I&#39;ll come immediately after breakfast.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank <i>you!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They had assumed another relation in life:
on one side of a chasm was a young husband
with his bride; on the other, the family physician.</p>

<p class="indent">As Dr. Birney poured out his coffee and
buttered his biscuit, he said to himself that now
the bread of life was being buttered.</p>

<p class="indent">When he reached the Ousleys&#39;, the youthful
husband met him on the veranda and threw an
arm around his shoulder affectionately and led
him in; and when some time later they reappeared,
both talked gravely and parted,
bound by a new bond of dependence and helpfulness
between man and man.</p>

<p class="indent">For the next few days there developed in
Dr. Birney a novel consciousness that his interest
in marriage had enormously deepened,
but that interest in his own marriage had
received a setback: the feeling was genuine,
and it troubled him. The tentative advances
into social life that he had been making seemed
to have ended in blind paths; the growing ties
snapped like threads upon which some displaced
weight has fallen.</p>

<p class="indent">What he had been looking for it seemed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
him that he had found too late in Josephine
Ousley. Had he found her before her marriage,
he would have looked at no other, nor
have wavered a year. The actual significance
of this was that he had encountered one of the
persistent dreams of mankind&mdash;the dream of
ideal love and ideal marriage with one who is
unattainable.</p>

<p class="indent">The history of the race, of its art, of its literature,
has borne through ages testimony to the
vividness and to the tyranny of this obsession,
this mistake, or this truth which may be one
of Nature&#39;s deepest. For it may be error and
it may be truth, or sometimes the one and
sometimes the other. It may be one of the
vast forces in Nature which we are but now
beginning to observe&mdash;one of her instincts of
intuitive selection which announces itself instantly
and is never to be reversed: such an
instinct as governs the mating of other lives
not human. But there it is in our own species
for us to make out of it what we can. There
are men who for the rest of their lives look
back upon the mere sight of some woman, a
solitary brief meeting with her, as though that
were their natural and perfect union. There
are women who are haunted by the same influence
and allegiance to some man&mdash;seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
once&mdash;perhaps never seen at all except in a
picture. Among the dreams of humanity about
ideal strength, ideal wisdom, ideal justice and
charity and friendship, this must be set apart
as its dream of ideal love; and as all high and
beautiful dreams about human nature are welcome,
provided only we never awaken from
them, let those who dream thus dream on.
But the tragedy of it falls upon those who in
actual life practically supplant the imagined.
Let Petrarch dream of Laura, let Dante dream
of Beatrice, if only the perfections of Laura and
Beatrice do not come into judgment against
the actual wives of Petrarchs and Dantes.
Let the ideal love of Romeo and Juliet gladden
mankind only as a dream of the unfulfilled.</p>

<p class="indent">Dr. Birney had fallen under the influence of
this error, or this truth: the bride of his friend
instantly filled his imagination as that vision
of perfection which dreams alone bring to visit
us. He was not yet in love with her, not a
feeling of his nature had yet made its start
towards her: but she had declared herself as for
him the ideal woman&mdash;ensphered in the unattainable.
As proof of this she released in him
from the hour of his meeting her finer things
than he had been aware of in his own nature:
her countenance, her form, her voice, her whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
presence, her spirit, disclosed for him for the first
time the whole glory and splendor of human life
and of a man&#39;s union with a woman.</p>

<p class="indent">As he tried to withdraw his mind from this
belief and fix it upon his own separate future,
he discovered that his outlook was no longer
single nor clear. Something stood in his path&mdash;an
irremovable obstacle. Sometimes in sleep
we try to drive around an obstruction in our
road, and as often as we drive around it it reappears
where it was before: such an obstruction
had obtruded itself across his progress.</p>

<p class="indent">During the following weeks he was often at
the Ousleys&#39;&mdash;to supper, as a guest in their
carriage on visits and to parties: the three were
almost inseparable. One night at supper young
Ousley again brought up the subject of the
doctor&#39;s marriage and twitted him for hesitancy:
unexpectedly the subject was thrust back into
the speaker&#39;s teeth: there was an awkward
silence&mdash;very curious&mdash;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">And now there befell the doctor one of those
peculiar little progressions or retrogressions
which prove a man not to be utterly forlorn.
He had ceased to make social calls, and had
begun to decline invitations; and so into the
air there was wafted that little myth which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
went wandering over the country from house
to house: the familiar little myth that he had
been rejected. This myth of the rejected!&mdash;this
little death-web wound about the unsuccessful
suitor: every eligible man is as much
entitled to one as every caterpillar to his cocoon.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">He was with Mrs. Ousley when her child
was born&mdash;he saved her life and the child&#39;s
life and his friend&#39;s happiness. And in response
he found that both of them were now
drawing him into that closer friendship which
rests upon danger shared and passed&mdash;upon
respect and power.</p>

<p class="indent">The first day that Mrs. Ousley sat in her
drawing-room with her infant across her knees
the doctor was there; and as he studied the
perfect group&mdash;husband and wife and child&mdash;it
seemed to him that behind them should
have shone the full-orbed golden splendor of
this life&#39;s ideal happiness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is only one way out of it for me,&quot;
he muttered bitterly as he went down the steps.
&quot;I must marry and fall in love with my own
wife and with the mother of my own children.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">That afternoon he drove toward the stately
homestead of the summer lawns and tennis
matches&mdash;but when he reached the front gate,
he drove past.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
It was a few months after this, toward the
end of a long conversation with Mrs. Ousley, in
which <i>she</i> now broached with feminine tact and
urgency the subject of his marriage, it was as he
told her good-by that there escaped from him
the first intimation of his love&mdash;unexpectedly
as an electric spark flashing across a vacuum.</p>

<p class="indent">When he was miles away he said to himself:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This must stop&mdash;this must be stopped:
if I cannot stop it, some one else must help
me to stop it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">That afternoon he began again his visits to
the stately homestead of the lawns and the
tennis courts; and a month or two later he
drove by and said to Mrs. Ousley:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am engaged to be married.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She gave him a quick startled look, thinking
not of him, but with a woman&#39;s intuitive forecast
sending her sympathy and apprehension
on into the life of another woman.</p>

<p class="indent">One beautiful summer night of the year following
there were bridal fights gleaming far
and wide over the grounds of this stately country
place and from all the windows of the house.</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor was married.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">About a year later there reached Dr. Birney
one morning a piece of evidence as to how his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
reputation was spreading: from another neighborhood
a farmer of small means rode to his
door and besought him to come and see a
member of his family: this request implied
that the regular family physician had been
passed over, supplanted; and when the poor
turn against their physicians and discharge
them, it is a bad sign indeed&mdash;for the physicians.</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor upon setting out sent his thoughts
to this professional brother who had been discredited:
he would gladly have saved him
from the wound.</p>

<p class="indent">A few miles up the pike he was surprised to
meet a well-known physician from the city:
they knew each other socially and checked their
horses to exchange greetings.</p>

<p class="indent">Dr. Birney lost no time in saying:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you are on the way to my house, I&#39;ll
turn back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m going to the Ousleys&#39;. Professor Ousley
asked me yesterday to come out and see Mrs.
Ousley: he said it was her wish.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The two physicians quickly parted with
embarrassment.</p>

<p class="indent">As Dr. Birney drove on he had received the
wound which sometimes leaves a physician with
the feeling that he has tasted the bitterness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
his own death: he himself had been pushed
aside&mdash;discarded from the household that
meant most to him as physician and man.</p>

<p class="indent">He pulled his horse&#39;s head into a dirt road
and crossed to another turnpike and visited his
new patient and went on to another county seat
and put up his horse at a livery stable to be
groomed and fed and took his dinner at the
little tavern and wandered aimlessly about the
town and started back towards sundown and
reached home late in the night and went to
his rooms without awaking his wife. As he
lighted his lamp in the library under its rays
he saw a note from Mrs. Ousley to them, asking
their company to supper next evening.
His wife had pencilled across the top of the
page a message that she would not go.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is their good-by to me,&quot; he said; &quot;when
my wife knows that they have discharged me,
as a woman understands another woman in
such a matter, she will know the reason; and
she will see fully at last what she began to see
long since.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When he went to the Ousleys&#39;, Mrs. Ousley
came forward to greet him at the side of her
husband, and she gave him both hands. And
she did what she had never done before&mdash;she
tried with her little hands to take his big ones&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span>
hands that had saved her life; and out of
the intensity and solemnity of her gratitude she
looked him in the eyes until the lids fell over
hers. It was like saying:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">It is not your fault, it is not my fault, it is not
the fault of any of us: it is life and the fault
of life. As I let you go, dear friend, I cling to
you.</p>

<p class="indent">When the evening was over and the moment
had come to leave, she was at the side of her
husband again; and under the chandelier in
the hall she suddenly looked up to it with a
beautiful mystical rapture and consecration&mdash;as
if to the mistletoe of her bridal eve.</p>

<p class="indent">And now more years&mdash;years&mdash;years! But
what effect have years upon the master passions?
What are five years to a master Hatred? What
are ten years to Revenge? What are twenty
to Malice? What is half a century to Patience,
or fourscore years to Loyalty, or fourscore and
ten to Friendship, or the last stretch of mortality
to waiting Love? The noble passions grow in
nobility; the ignoble ones grow in ignominy.</p>

<p class="indent">And thus it came about that the final
stage of the doctor&#39;s Progress attained dimensions
large enough to contain Hogarth&#39;s most
human four: for it represented that <i>Progress</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>
<i>of the Rake</i> which sometimes in everyday reality
coincides with the <i>Progress of the Harlot</i> and with
the <i>Progress of Marriage à la Mode</i> and with the
<i>Progress of Cruelty</i>: so that he thus achieved
as much by way of getting on as may be reasonably
demanded of any plodding man.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">It was an August day in this same year which
was now closing its record with the thoughtful
days of December. It was afternoon, and it
was Saturday.</p>

<p class="indent">Intervening years had developed the doctor
in two phases of growth: he looked no older,
but he was heavier in trunk and limbs; and
he was weightier in repute, for he had established
far and near his fame as a physician.
He had patients in remote county seats now,
and on this day he had been to one of those
county seats to visit a patient, and had found
him mending. As he quitted the house with
this responsibility dropped, it further reminded
him that within the range of his practice he had
not for the moment a single case of critical
illness or of any great suffering. Whereupon
he experienced the relief, the elastic rebound,
known perhaps only to physicians when for a
term they may take up relations of entire health
and happiness with their fellow-beings: and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
when you cease to deal with pain, you begin to
deal with pleasure.</p>

<p class="indent">With a new buoyancy of foot and feeling he
started down to Cheapside, the gathering-place
for farmers and merchants and friendly town
folk&mdash;most of all on Saturdays. As he
strolled along, the recollection wandered back
to him of how in years gone by&mdash;when he
was just old enough to begin to shave&mdash;it
was the excitement of the week to shave and
take his bath and don his best and come to
town to enjoy Saturday afternoon on Cheapside.
The spirit of boyhood flowed back to
him: he bathed in a tide of warm mysterious
waters.</p>

<p class="indent">When he reached the public square, he began
to shake hands and rub shoulders; and to nod
at more distant acquaintances; and once under
the awning of a store for agricultural implements
he paused squarely before a group of
farmers sitting about on ploughs and harrows.
They were all friends, and at the sight of him
they rose in a group, seized him and marched
him off with them to the hotel to dinner whither
they were just starting. They were hearty
men; it was a hearty meal; there was hearty
talk, hearty laughter. Middle-aged, red-blooded
men of overflowing vitality, open-faced,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
sunbrowned; eating meat like self-unconscious
carnivora and drinking water like
cattle: premium animals in prime condition
and ready for action: on each should have
been tied the blue ribbon of agricultural fairs.</p>

<p class="indent">The hotel dinner was unusually rich that
day because a great circus and menagerie had
pitched its tents in a vacant lot on the edge of
town; and there was to be an afternoon and
an evening performance, and the town was
crowded.</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor&#39;s dinner companions were to join
their wives and children at the grounds, and
very reluctantly he declined their urging to go
along: as they separated, there rose in him
fresh temptation about old Saturday afternoon
liberties and pleasures&mdash;and there fell upon
him as a blight the desolation of his own home
life.</p>

<p class="indent">He made his way through excited throngs to
the livery stable, and had soon started. On the
way across town, above low roofs and fences,
he caught sight of weather-stained canvas tents,
every approach toward which now had its rolling
tide of happy faces, young and aged. At a
cross street the hurrying people flowed so
thoughtlessly about his buggy wheels that he
checked his horse lest some too careless child
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
might be trodden on; and as he sat there,
smiling out at them and waiting for them to
pass, suddenly above the tumult of voices with
their brotherliness he heard a sound that made
him forget his surroundings&mdash;forget human
kinship&mdash;and think only of another kinship
of his to something secret and undeclared: in
one of the tents a great lonely beast lifted its
voice and roared out its deep jungle-cry. The
primitive music rang above the civilized swarm
like a battle-challenge uttered from the heart of
Nature&mdash;that sad long trumpet call of instinct&mdash;caged
and defrauded; a majestic despair for
things within that could never change and for
things without that were never to be enjoyed.
Shallow and pitiable by comparison sounded the
human voices about the buggy wheels.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>To make one outcry like that!&mdash;sincere,
free! But to be heard once&mdash;but to be understood
at last!</i>&quot; said the doctor.</p>

<p class="indent">When he reached the outskirts of the town,
he met vehicles hurrying in from the neighborhood
and from far beyond it.</p>

<p class="indent">It was not long before he saw his own carriage
approaching; and his children, recognizing him,
sprang to their feet and waved tumultuously.
As the vehicles drew alongside, he looked at
them rather absent-mindedly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
&quot;Where are you running off to?&quot; he asked,
pretending not to remember that permission
had been granted weeks before, as soon as the
bills had been pasted on turnpike fences.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;re running off to the circus!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what can you possibly be going to do
at the circus? Children go to a circus&mdash;who
ever heard of such a thing! I should think
you&#39;d have stayed at home and studied arithmetic
or memorized the capitals of all the States.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, as for me,&quot; cried Elsie, &quot;I&#39;m pleased
to explain what I shall do: I shall drink lemonade
and sit with the fat woman if there&#39;s room
for both of us on the same plank!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what are <i>you</i> going to do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m going to do <i>everything</i>, of course! That&#39;s
my ticket: I don&#39;t pay for all and see some!
I&#39;m going to do everything.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Everything is a good deal,&quot; commented
the doctor introspectively. &quot;Everything is a
good deal; but do what you can toward it&mdash;as
you have paid the price.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a while he mused how childhood wants
all of whatever it craves: its desire is as single
as its eye. Only later in life we come to know&mdash;or
had better know&mdash;that we may have the
whole of very little: that a small part of anything
is our wisest portion, and the instant anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
becomes entirely ours, it becomes lost to
us or we become lost to it: the bright worlds
that last for ages revolve&mdash;they do not collide.</p>

<p class="indent">He was still thinking of this when he met the
carriage of Professor Ousley; and the two
middle-aged friends, who in their lives had
never passed each other on the road without
stopping, stopped now. Professor Ousley got
out and came across to the doctor&#39;s buggy and
greeted him with fresh concerned cordiality.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It has come at last,&quot; he announced, as though
something long talked of between them could
be thus referred to; and he drew out a letter
which he handed in to be read; it was a call to
a professorship in a Northern university. As
the doctor read it and reread it (continuing to
read because he did not know what to say)&mdash;as
he thus read, he began to look like a man
grown ill.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have accepted, of course,&quot; he said
barely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have accepted.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The friends were silent with their faces turned
in the same direction across the country&mdash;their
land, the land of generations of their people.
This breaking up would be the end for them of
the near tie of soil and tradition and boyhood
friendship and the friendship of manhood.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
&quot;Well,&quot; said the doctor unsteadily, &quot;this is
what you have been working for.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is what I have been working for,&quot;
assented Professor Ousley.</p>

<p class="indent">These intermediate years had wrought their
changes in him also; within and without;
he was grown heavy, and as an American scholar
he had weight. The doctor clung for safety
to his one theme:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have outgrown your place here in Kentucky.
A larger world has heard of you and
sends for you because it needs you. Well
done! But when I became a Kentucky country
doctor, it was for life. No greater world for
me! My only future is to try to do better the
same work in the same place&mdash;always better
and better if possible till it is over. You climb
your mountain range; I stay in my valley.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Professor Ousley drew out another envelope:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Read that,&quot; he said a little sadly, and sadness
was rare with him: it was an advertisement
for the town paper announcing for sale
his house and farm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is the beginning of the end,&quot; he said.
&quot;It is our farewell to Kentucky, to you, to our
past, but not, I hope, to our future. Herbert
and Elizabeth will have to be looked out for
in the future: Elizabeth may refuse to leave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
the neighborhood, who knows?&quot; He laughed
with fatherly fondness and gentleness.</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor laughed with him: that plighting
of their children!</p>

<p class="indent">At this moment a spring wagon came hastening
on: it was the servants of the Ousley
household.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you have left your mistress by herself,&quot;
the master called out to them as they passed.
They replied with their bashful hilarity that
she herself had sent them away, that she was
glad to be well rid of them. As the wagon
regained the middle of the road and disappeared,
Professor Ousley looked at the doctor
with a meaning that may have been deeper
than his smile:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She sent us away, too&mdash;me and the children.
She wanted the day to herself. Of
course this change, the going away, the wrenching
loose from memories of life in the house
there since our marriage&mdash;of course, all that
no other one of us can feel as she feels it. My
work marches away, I follow my work, she
follows me, the children follow her. Duty
heads the procession. It pulls us all up by
the roots and drags us in the train of service:
we are all servants, work is lord. I understood
her to-day&mdash;I was glad to bring the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
children and to be absent from her myself:
these hours of looking backward and of looking
forward are sacred to her&mdash;it is her woman&#39;s
right to be alone.&quot; He drew the doctor into
these confidences as one not outside intimate
sacred things. The doctor made no reply.</p>

<p class="indent">He drove on now, not aware how he drove.
A few more vehicles passed, and then a mile or
two farther out no more: they had ceased to
come: he was entering the silent open country.</p>

<p class="indent">A Kentucky landscape of August afternoon&mdash;Saturday
afternoon! The stillness! The
dumb pathos of garnered fields&mdash;that spectacle
of the great earth dutiful to its trust and
now discharged of obligation! That acute
pang of seeing with what loyalty the vows
of the year have been kept by soil and sun,
and are ended and are now no more! The
first intimations also of changes soon to come&mdash;the
chill of early autumn nights when the
moon rises on the white frost of fences and
stubble, and when outside windows glowing
with kindled hearths the last roses freeze. Of
all seasons, of all the days with which nature
can torture us, none so wound without striking;
none awaken such pain, such longing: all
desire offers itself to be harvested.</p>

<p class="indent">There was no glare of sunlight this afternoon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
nor any shape of cloud, but a haze which
took away shadows from fences and bushes
and wayside trees and weeds, and left the
earth and things on it in a radiance between
light and shadow&mdash;between day and darkness.
It was a troubled brooding: and when the surfaces
are quiet, then begins the calling of the
deeps to the deeps.</p>

<p class="indent">As the doctor advanced into this stillness of
the land, there reached his ear, as one last
reverberation, that long lonely roar of the
great animal homesick and life-sick for jungle
and jungle freedom; for the right to be what
nature had made it&mdash;rebellious agony!</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><i>A day to herself! She had sent them all away,
husband, and children, and servants! The right
to be alone with memories ... under the still
surface the invitation of the deeps....</i></p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Dr. Birney&#39;s buggy was nearing the front
gate of Professor Ousley&#39;s farm. When he
reached it, he checked his horse and sat
awhile. Then he got out and looked up the
pike and down the pike: it might have been an
instinct to hail any one passing&mdash;he looked
dazed&mdash;like a man not altogether under self-control.
Not a soul was in sight.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
He drove in.</p>

<p class="indent">The main driveway approached the house
almost straight; but a few yards inside the
gate there branched from it another which led
toward the sequestered portions of the grounds.
It was private and for pleasure: it formed a
feature of the landscape gardening of earlier
times when country places were surrounded by
parklike lawns and forests and stone fences.
It skirted the grounds at a distance from the
house, passed completely round it, and returned
to the main driveway at the point where it
started. Thus it lay about the house&mdash;a
circle.</p>

<p class="indent">Slowly the doctor&#39;s buggy began to enclose
the house within this circle, this coil, this arm
creeping around and enclosing a form.</p>

<p class="indent">In spots along the drive the shrubbery was
dense, and forest trees overhung. He had
scarcely entered it when a bird flitted across his
path: softest of all creatures that move on
wings, with its long gliding flight, a silken
voluptuous grace of movement&mdash;the rain-crow.
It flew before him a short distance and
alighted on a low overhanging bough&mdash;its
breast turned, as waiting for him. Its wings
during that flight resembled the floating draperies
of a woman fleeing with outstretched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span>
arms; and as it now sat quiet and inviting, its
throat looked like a soft throat&mdash;bared.</p>

<p class="indent">Once the doctor&#39;s buggy passed a flower-bed
the soil of which showed signs of having been
lately upturned: a woman&#39;s trowel lay on the
edge of the sod: some one had been working
there; perhaps some deep restlessness had
ended the work. Here the atmosphere was
sweet with rose geranium and heliotrope: it
was the remotest part of the ground, screened
from any distant view. And once the buggy
curtains struck against the spray of a rosebush
and the petals fell on the empty cushion beside
the doctor and upon his knees. The horse
moved so slowly along this forest path of beauty
and privacy that no ear could have heard its
approach as it passed round the house and
returned to the main drive. Here the doctor
sat awhile.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he pulled the head of the horse toward
the house.</p>

<p class="indent">He reached the top of the drive. At the end
of a short pavement stood the house. The
front doors were closed&mdash;not locked. It
stood there in the security of its land and of
its history, and of traditions and ideals. Undefended
except by these: with faith that nothing
else could so well defend.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
On one side of the pavement was built an old-fashioned
ornament of Southern lawns&mdash;a
vine-covered, rose-covered summer-house within
which could be seen rugs and chairs and a worktable:
some one had been at work; that same
deep restlessness had perhaps terminated pastime
here. Near the other end of the house
two glass doors, framed like windows, opened
upon a single stone step in the grass; and within
these doors hung a thin white drapery of summer
curtains; and under the festoon of these curtains
there was visible from the doctor&#39;s buggy
half the still figure of a woman&mdash;reclining.</p>

<p class="indent">She had bespoken a day for solitude. And
now she sat there, deep in the reverie of the
years.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Surely through that reverie ran the memory
of a Christmas Eve when her husband had
brought her home with him, and, leading her
to this same bed-chamber, to a place under
the chandelier from which mistletoe hung, had
taken her in his arms; and as his warm breath
broke against her face, his lips, hardly more
than a youth&#39;s then, had uttered one haunting
phrase: <i>bride of the mistletoe</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Now had come the year for the closing
scene of youth&#39;s romance in the house&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
romance that already for years had been going
its quiet way to extinction. The shorn group
of them were soon to pass out of it into a
vaster world: the young lover of the hearth
had become the middle-aged lover of humanity.</p>

<p class="indent">And through the reverie ran thoughts of the
other man who had been near during all this
time&mdash;defrauded of her&mdash;his ideal; baffled
in his desire; a man with a love of her that
had been a long prayer and a madness: to
whom she owed her life: this other man to be
left behind here amid the old familiar fields&mdash;with
his love of her ruining his home.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The doctor got out of his buggy noiselessly.
He loosened the horse&#39;s check-rein without knowing
what he did; and the surprised animal
turned its head and touched him inquiringly
in his side with its nose. He thrust his forefinger
down inside his collar and pulled it with
the gesture of a man who felt himself choking.
He could not&mdash;for some reason&mdash;hear his
own feet on the pavement nor on the steps as
he mounted the porch. On one side in the
shadow of old vines stood a settee with cushions;
and at the head of it a little table with books
opened and unopened: that same deep restlessness
had ended reading. As he grasped the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
knob of the bell, it slipped from his hand and
there was a loud clangor.</p>

<p class="indent">She stepped quickly out upon the stone
before her door, and at recognition of him,
with a smile and gesture of welcome, she disappeared
within. The next moment the front
door was opened wide; but at the sight of his
face&mdash;with an instinct perhaps the oldest that
the race knows and that needs never to be explained&mdash;she
took one step backward. Then
she recovered herself, and, unsupported, she
stood there on the threshold of her home.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Water!</i>&quot; His death-white lips framed the
word without a sound.</p>

<p class="indent">He watched her pass quickly down the hall
till she disappeared. Turning away, he sat
down beside the small table of books in the
shadow of the vines; and he fixed his blood-swollen
eyes on the door, waiting for her to
return. She came unwaveringly, and without a
word placed the glass of water beside him, and
then she passed out of sight behind him.</p>

<p class="indent">A long time he remained there. Close to his
ear out of the depths of the honeysuckle came
the twittering of a brood of nestlings as the
mother went to and fro&mdash;a late brood, the
first having met with tragedy, or the second
love-mating of the season.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span>
Then upon the stillness another sound broke&mdash;a
plain warning to his ear. It was a scraping
of the buggy wheel against the buggy,
showing that his horse, finding its check-rein
loosened, but being too well trained to move,
had turned short to crop the grass beside the
driveway.</p>

<p class="indent">How the homely things, the pitiable trifles
reach us amid life&#39;s immensities!</p>

<p class="indent">This overturning of a buggy! The overturning
of lives!</p>

<p class="indent">He started down the steps, and then midway
between the house and the buggy he saw her.</p>

<p class="indent">She stood a few yards from him across the
grass at one of the entrances of the summer
house where she had been working at her
needlework. She stood there, not waiting for
him to come&mdash;but waiting for him to go.
For years he had followed her as along a path:
this was the end of the path: neither could go
farther.</p>

<p class="indent">And now, turning at the end of the path,
she meant to make him understand&mdash;understand
her better and understand himself better.</p>

<p class="indent">And so she stood there facing him, the
whole glowing picture of her wifehood and
motherhood and womanhood: not in fear nor
anger, nor with any reproach for him nor any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
stain for herself: but with the deepest understanding
and sympathy in a great tragedy&mdash;and
with her friendship.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she turned away and with quiet steps
took a slender path which led to those sequestered
portions of the grounds where she
had left her trowel and geraniums and heliotropes.
Slowly along this labyrinth of verdure,
under the branches of the old forest trees, she
passed. Now a shrub partly hid her: once
the long bough of a rose tree touched her
shoulder and dropped the petals of its blossoms
behind her. Farther away, farther away, then
lost down the dim glade.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The buggy crept homeward along the pike.
The horse hung its head low; the reins lay
on the dashboard; with its obscure sense that
something was wrong it struck the gait with
which it had always yielded obedience to the
sadnesses of the land&mdash;and moved along the
highway as behind a death.</p>

<p class="indent">Past farms of happy husbands and wives
and children! Past fences on which, a bareheaded
boy, he had once liked to come out
and sit and watch people pass; or to meet
his uncle as he returned home. Past the little
roadside church, its doors and windows so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span>
tightly shut now during the week, where years
before he had sat one morning and had shot
the arrow of a boy&#39;s satire at the Commandment
for men only.</p>

<p class="indent">Two voices for him that day&mdash;the same
two that are in every man, the only two in
any man: the cry of the jungle&mdash;I <i>will</i>&mdash;and
the voice of the mountain-top&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">Thou Shalt Not.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span></p>

<p class="h2">EVERGREEN AND THORN TREE</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Four</span> months had elapsed since that August
afternoon of summer heat and passion&mdash;not
a lengthy period as reckoned on the mere unemotional
calendar. But changes in our lives
are not measurable by days: we may spend
eventless years with no inner or outer sign of
growth, and then some hour may bring a readjustment,
an advancement, of our whole being.
The oriental story of Saul of Tarsus, made a
changed man by a voice or a vision of heavenly
things, is human and natural, and for this reason
if for no other has been credible to thousands of
men&mdash;this reversal of direction on life&#39;s road.</p>

<p class="indent">As Dr. Birney now on the morning of this
twenty-fourth of December sat in his library,
trying to make out the bills of the year, and
there lay disclosed before him the book of the
years&mdash;the story of his life from boyhood up&mdash;he
by and by abandoned the filling out of
blanks against his professional neighbors and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
began to cast up as at the end of no previous
year his own human debt to the better ideals
of his fellow-beings&mdash;and to himself. And
Nature, who was grievously in his debt but had
no notion of paying, Nature stood at his shoulder
and pressed him for settlement in that old
formula of hers: you need not have opened
this account with Nature, but since it has been
opened, there is no closing it. It runs until
you are declared bankrupt; and you are not
bankrupt until you are dead. Then of course
as a business firm I shall lose what I have not
already collected from you; but there are
enough others to keep the concern prosperous
and going. Meantime&mdash;make a partial payment
<i>now</i>: payment in suffering, payment in
expiation, payment in self-repudiation. If you
have any funds invested in a habit of inferiority,
they are acceptable: I levy on them.</p>

<p class="indent">One particular fact this morning had riveted
Dr. Birney&#39;s attention upon the slow inexorable
grinding of these mills of life.</p>

<p class="indent">For years the unhappiness of his domestic
affairs&mdash;the withdrawal of his wife from him
under his roof&mdash;had by insensible stages
travelled as a story to all other homesteads in
that region. In his own house it had always
remained a mute tragedy: each of the two who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
bore the yoke of it made no willing sign; each
turned toward their world the unbetraying
countenance. And it must be remembered that
half a century ago and less you might have
journeyed inquisitively through the length and
breadth of that land and have found probably
not one case of divorce nor of separation without
divorce: among that people marriage was
truly for better or for worse&mdash;a great binding
and unalterable sacrament of blended lives.
If after marriage love&#39;s young dream ended,
then you lived on where you were&mdash;wide
awake; if all gorgeous colors left the clouds
and the clouds left the sky, you stood the
blistering sun; if it turned out to be oil and
water poured together, at least it was oil and
water within the same priceless cruet: and
the perpetuity of the cruet was considered of
more value to society than the preservation of
a little oil and water.</p>

<p class="indent">No divorce then nor separation in his case;
nor any voluntary vulgarization of the truth,
and yet a widely diffused knowledge of this
truth among neighbors, among his brother
physicians, in county seats, and away down on
that lower level of the domestic servants, the
proudest experience of whose lives is perhaps
the discovery of something to criticise in those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
far above them: is it not a personal triumph
to level a pocket telescope on the sun?</p>

<p class="indent">And all this Dr. Birney had grown used to
through Nature&#39;s kind indurations: all of us
have to grow used to so much; and perhaps
there is no surer test for any of us than how
much we can bear. But in one of life&#39;s directions
only&mdash;in the direction of his children&mdash;his
outlook had hitherto been as refreshing to
him as sunlight on the young April verdure of
the land. In that direction had still been left
him complete peace, because there still dwelt
spotlessness.</p>

<p class="indent">But the father had long dreaded the arrival
in his children of an age when they must commence
to see things in their home which they
could not understand or in fairness judge. He
carried that old dread felt by so many parents
that by and by the children will be forced to
understand&mdash;and to misunderstand&mdash;the lack
of something in the house. It was for this
very reason that permission had the more gladly
been granted them this year to celebrate their
Christmas elsewhere; for this festival brings
into relief as nothing else the domestic peace
of a fireside or the discords that mar the lives
of those gathered in coldness about its warmth.</p>

<p class="indent">And now the long expected had arrived.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>
His conversation with his little boy that morning
before the two children had darted off for
their Christmas away from home had brought
the announcement: the boy was at last mature
enough to begin to put his own interpretation
upon the estrangement of his parents. Moreover,
the son now believed that he had found
the father out, had penetrated to his secret;
and the doctor recalled the words which had
conveyed this youthful judgment to him:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>If I should get tired of Elizabeth and wanted
a little change and fell in love with another man&#39;s
wife&mdash;</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was the snow-white annunciation!
There the doctor got insight into the direction
that a young life tended to take! There was
the milestone already reached by the traveller!
That is, his son out of devotion to him had
already entered into a kind of partnership in
his father&#39;s marital unfaithfulness. The boy
had laughed in his father&#39;s eyes with elation at
his own loyalty.</p>

<p class="indent">These tidings of degeneracy it was that so
arrested the doctor on this day. The influence
of the house had at last reached the only remaining
field thus far unreached; and now the
seeds of suggestion had been dropped from one
ripened life into new soil, sowing the world&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
harvest over again&mdash;that old, old harvest&mdash;of
tares and tears. Hitherto his tragedy had
been communicated to his own generation;
now it had dropped into the next generation:
it had been sown past his own life futureward.</p>

<p class="indent">The shock of this discovery had befallen him
just when Dr. Birney had begun to extricate
himself from his whole past; when he had
begun to hope that it might somehow begin to
be effaced, sponged away.</p>

<p class="indent">For although but four months had passed
from that August afternoon to this December
morning, a great change had been wrought in
him.</p>

<p class="indent">When on the day following that sad August
one he about the middle of the forenoon had
driven distractedly into Professor Ousley&#39;s yard,
he saw that friend of his youth, the man he
loved best of men, the most nearly perfect
character he knew among men,&mdash;he saw him
sitting on a rustic bench under an old forest
tree inside his front gate,&mdash;waiting for him.
Beside him on the bench lay papers over which
he was working&mdash;not because he enjoyed work
at that moment probably, but because it was
impossible to sit there and wait with empty
hands&mdash;with his mind tortured by one thought,
the sorrow and shame of this meeting.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
As the doctor somehow got out of his buggy
and started across the grass toward him, he
did not look up because he could not look up
at once; and he did not rise and come to meet
him; it was impossible&mdash;for a moment. But
then with a high bracing of himself&mdash;he came.
And coming, he showed in his face only deep
emotion, anxiety, distress, such as a true man
might feel for another true man who had been
caught in one of life&#39;s disasters. As a friend
might walk toward a friend who from perfect
health had by some accident of machinery
tottered to him mangled; or as to a friend of
wealth who through some false investment had
by a turn of fortune&#39;s wheel been left penniless;
or as to a friend of sound eyesight who
had suddenly lost the power of right vision;
or as to a friend who travelling a straight road
across a perilous country had by some atrophy
or lesion of the brain lost his bearings and was
found wandering over a precipice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you do, Downs?&quot; he called out,
using the old first name which for years now
he had dropped, the boyish name of complete
boyish friendship. &quot;Come and sit down,&quot; he
said, and he wound his arm through the doctor&#39;s
and all but supported him until they
reached the seat under the tree.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
And then, without waiting or wavering or
looking at his friend&#39;s face, most of all without
allowing him to utter a word (like a man
aroused to the battle of a whole life which concentrated
itself then and there), he turned to
his papers and began to speak of the future&mdash;of
the professorship with its new work, new
duties, new services&mdash;to the going away from
Kentucky: not once did he turn the talk away
from the new, the future, except that when he
finished he covered the whole theme by saying
that the old ties must hold fast and become
the dearer for the separation. He wanted the
doctor&#39;s advice, insisted upon having it, forced
him too on into this future. Not a word, not
a look of the eye, not a note in the voice, about
a thing so near, too near.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now this is the end of that,&quot; he said, putting
the papers away. &quot;But it all brings up
something else: the farther we go forward, the
longer we look backward; and the future, this
new future, has turned my eyes all the more
toward the past, Downs, our past&mdash;yours
and mine!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And so he began to talk about this past.
He went back to their boyhood together. He
laughed over the time when he began to go
to the manor house every Saturday to stay all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span>
night. He declared that he had expected the
first time to starve in a house where there
were no women; but to his astonishment&mdash;and
relief&mdash;he had found that he had devoured
things as never before. He had not been prepared
to say&mdash;speaking for the boy he then
was&mdash;that a woman at the table took away
his appetite; but there was the fact, unquestionable
and satisfying, that at the table with
males only he had discovered bodily abysses
within himself that had never been called into
requisition! He was as frivolous as all this,
winding quietly along through those happy
years.</p>

<p class="indent">He recalled another incident: that during
one of their first rabbit hunts they had fired
almost simultaneously at the same rabbit.
As neither could claim the glory of killing it,
they had decided that at least they must share
equally the glory of its pelt. And so, measuring
to an equal distance from the tip of its nose and
the tip of its tail, they had there inserted a penknife
and severed the skin; and then, propping
their boots, soles against soles, like those resolved
on a tug of war, and each taking hold of his half
of the skin, with one mighty jerk backwards
each was in possession of his trophy! He was
as frivolous as that. Nor would he ever leave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
this theme of their friendship, weaving about
it here and there remembered tricks and escapades
as he traced it down&mdash;this bond in
their lives. (There were such friendships in
those days.)</p>

<p class="indent">And so he poured out a man&#39;s tribute to a
man&#39;s friendship; and then quickly with a
change of tone by which we all may intimate
to a visitor that his visit is at an end, he bade
the doctor take his leave. But he did one
thing first&mdash;one little thing:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Josephine sent you these, and told me to
pin them on you, with her love,&quot; he said with
a tremor of the mouth, his eyes filling; and
taking from the lapel of his coat a little freshly
plucked bunch of heliotrope and rose geranium,
he leaned affectionately over against the
doctor&#39;s shoulder and pinned the flowers on
his breast.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he held out his hand as if to drag the
doctor to his feet, walked with him to the buggy,
pushed him in, put the reins in his palm, and
gave a slap to the horse to start it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come to see us, Downs,&quot; he said; &quot;we
can&#39;t have you much longer.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Truly if the rest of us had nobility enough to
treat one another&#39;s failings with sympathy and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
understanding, there would be few tragedies
for us in our human lives, except the inevitable
tragedies of nature.</p>

<p class="indent">The way in which these two friends instead
of turning away from him instantly turned
toward him, sparing not themselves that they
might rescue him from what now might swiftly
and easily be utter ruin&mdash;this most human
touch of most human nobleness wrought in him
a revelation and a revolution.</p>

<p class="indent">On one day he had gone to the end of the long
path of temptation: there was relief in that even.
And on the next what is finest in human nature
had come to his rescue. And both of these
things changed him. Every day since had been
changing him. The unlifted shadow that had
overlain the landscape of his life had begun
to break up into moving shadows traversed
by rifts of light: a ravishing greenness began
to reappear in the world. That old irremovable
obstruction across his road had been withdrawn:
once again there was a clear path and single
vision.</p>

<p class="indent">But the sower may become a new character;
the growth of what he has sowed must go on.
And the doctor with a vision clarified and
corrected now saw thriving everywhere around
him young plants the germs of which he had so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
long been scattering. A farmer might from a
field by dint of infinite patience and searching
recover every seed that he had thrown forth;
but as well might he try to gather back a shower
of raindrops from dry clods.</p>

<p class="indent">And as the doctor sat in his library that morning
with this final announcement to him of
how things sown were growing in the nature of
his little boy, it seemed to him the moment to
call upon Nature for a settlement&mdash;Nature who
never fails to collect a bill, but who never pays
one. And sitting there with the whole subject
before him as a physician studying his own case,
he asked of Nature whether without any will
of his own she had not started him in life with
too great susceptibility to the power of suggestion.
Far back when his character was being
moulded, had not Nature seen to it that wrong
suggestions were sown in him? Had not all his
trouble started there? Was not <i>he</i> harvesting
what he had not scattered? This immeasurable
power of suggestion, this new mystery
which innumerable minds were now trying
to fathom, to govern, to apply. This fresh
field of research for his own science of medicine&mdash;this
wounding and this healing, this waylaying
and misleading, by suggestion. This
plan of Nature that no human being should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span>
escape it, that it should be the very ether which
all must breathe.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Meantime out of doors the face of Nature
had rapidly changed; his forecast of early
morning had been fulfilled: the wind had died
down, clouds had overspread the sky, and it was
snowing rapidly. On turnpike and lane and
crossroads there was falling the dry snow of
true winter when there is sleighing.</p>

<p class="indent">He had given up work and had long been
walking restlessly to and fro from one room to
another; and now as he stood at a window and
looked out at the mantle of ermine being woven
for all unsightly things, at the hiding away of
the year&#39;s blots and stains under the one new
spotlessness, his thoughts buried themselves
with getting out his own sleigh and with his
trip across country in the afternoon to the homes
of the sick children. But more intimately he
thought of the long drive homeward from the
distant county seat late that night&mdash;with his
memories of Christmas Eve.</p>

<p class="indent">He turned from the window, and going to
his office set about the work of mending the
sleigh-bells. For some reason he did this
most quietly lest they should send any sound
through the stillness of the house. Once as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
bell tumbled out of its place, instinctively he
put his hand over it as though it were human
and he must silence its mouth of merriment.
Sleigh-bells seemed out of place in these rooms;
they threw their music into old wounds. When
he had finished, he put them just inside the door
of the small room opening toward the stable
where his man could take them away without
making any noise.</p>

<p class="indent">And now another sound caught the doctor&#39;s
ear as he was washing his hands.</p>

<p class="indent">It was half past twelve o&#39;clock; and his wife
had entered the dining-room to begin some
early preparations for dinner, and she was alone.
She wished no maid to-day, apparently, at least
not yet; and as she moved familiarly about
there reached his ear&mdash;very low, sung wholly
to herself&mdash;the melody of a ballad.</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor knew it&mdash;words and music: it
was the <i>Ballad of the Trees and the Master</i>.
In this the poet&mdash;a Southern poet who himself
alike through genius and suffering had
entered while on earth into the divine&mdash;in
this the poet had represented the Son of Man
as going into the woods when his hour was
near; into the woods for such strength as the
forest only may sometimes give us: the same
forest out of which humanity itself had emerged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
when it began its troubled history of search
for the ideal.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus her song was not of the Christmas
Tree and of the Manger when Divine love
arrives; but of the tree of the Crucifixion and
of love&#39;s betrayal and sacrifice ere it goes away.
It was not the carol of the whole happy world
at this hour for Bethlehem, but the hymn of
Calvary&mdash;the music of the thorn tree and of
the Crown of Thorns.</p>

<p class="indent">And this from his wife on Christmas Eve!&mdash;not
for his ear: not for any one&#39;s ear: but
to herself alone.</p>

<p class="indent">As he listened, with an overmastering impulse
he walked to the corner of the library and
stood before her picture. He noticed that in
the careless haste of holiday house-cleaning
to-day the servant had left on the glass of the
frame some finger-prints, some particles of dust.
He brought a little moistened antiseptic sponge
and a little red-cross gauze, and softly cleaned
it as though he were touching a wound. Then
he returned to the window and watched the
snow falling and heard his wife&#39;s song through
to the end.</p>

<p class="indent">It was she to whom he owed everything. It
was she who, a few years after their marriage,
having discovered herself to be an unloved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
bride, had thrown her whole agonized nature
into the one remaining chance of winning his
love as young wife and young mother. Having
seen that hope pass from her, she had withdrawn
from one tragedy into a lesser one: she
had withdrawn from him. And so withdrawing,
she held the whole power of ruining him.
Divorce&mdash;open separation&mdash;and his career as
a physician in that land would have been ended.</p>

<p class="indent">Instead, she too had come to his rescue.
Slowly out of that too swift and pitiless a fate
for her own life, she had begun to work for the
success of his: it was of too much value to
many to be brought to nothingness for the
disappointment of one.</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor stood there, looking out at the
snowstorm and thinking how all the people
who could most have destroyed him had
spared not themselves to make him happy and
successful and useful.</p>

<p class="indent">The dining-room doors were thrown open&mdash;he
went in to dinner.</p>

<p class="h2">PART II</p>

<h2>I</h2>

<p class="h2">TWO OTHER WINTER SNOWBIRDS AT A WINDOW</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you see them coming, Elizabeth?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not yet&mdash;except in my mind&#39;s eye.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your mind&#39;s eye! Always that mind&#39;s eye!
Till you see them with something better than your
mind&#39;s eye, don&#39;t disturb me, Elizabeth. I have
just come to the Battle of Hastings. I am
going to fight as King Harold. Old William
the Conqueror has just finished saying his hypocritical
prayers. I am arming for him!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Arm away!&quot; said Elizabeth, never interested
in arming.</p>

<p class="indent">She stood at the sunny window of the library.
With one rosy finger-nail she had scratched some
frost off a window-pane, and with her face close
to the clear spot was peeping out. Her fingers
tapped a contented ditty on the window-sill.</p>

<p class="indent">A few minutes later the other voice was
heard again: it came from the direction of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
sofa in the room, and seemed to rise out of half-smothering
cushions:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;While the battle is going on, you might look
around once more for the key, Elizabeth. Likely
enough they have it hid somewhere in here.
They got the Tree into the house last night
without our catching them. And after they
think we are asleep to-night, they&#39;ll hang the
presents on, and to-morrow they&#39;ll pretend
they didn&#39;t. But we can&#39;t let them go on
treating us like infants, or as if we were no better
than immigrants. That&#39;s what little immigrants
believe! And that&#39;s how we got the
notion in this country. Old William was an
immigrant! But I wouldn&#39;t loathe him as I do
if he hadn&#39;t been one of the hypocritical praying
immigrants. He could have prayed without
being a hypocrite, Elizabeth; and he could
have been a hypocrite without praying; but he
wanted to be both, the old beast!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But he stopped praying centuries ago,
Harold,&quot; said Elizabeth, rubbing her long nose
against the window-pane as though she had a
mind to shorten it on a grindstone. &quot;Can&#39;t
you find enough in the world to fight without
going away back to fight William the Conqueror?
What have we Kentucky children
got to do with William the Conqueror on Christmas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
Eve! And suppose he was a hypocrite
then; he can&#39;t be a hypocrite <i>now</i>! If he went
where it&#39;s nicest to go, it must have been taken
out of him by this time; and if he went where
they say it is not so nice, O dear! of course,
I don&#39;t know what became of it <i>there</i>; it may
have exploded; it may have blown him up.&quot;
Elizabeth had begun her earliest study of chemistry;
she disliked explosive gases.</p>

<p class="indent">A few minutes later the deliberate voice rose
out of the sofa pillows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish it had been me to turn the heat on
him: I&#39;d have made him sizzle! If you find
the key, lay it aside quietly, Elizabeth. By
that time the moon may be shining down on
the battle-field where I am dead among my
common soldiers, all of us covered with gore:
let the king lie there with them as one of them:
doesn&#39;t that sound fine?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not to me!&quot; said Elizabeth. &quot;It sounds
like nonsense: what&#39;s the matter with <i>your</i>
mind&#39;s eye, I beg to inquire?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth was nondescript. Her hair was
golden-red and as soft as woven wind. Her
skin had the fairness of peach bloom when bees
are coming and going in the sunlit air and there
is such sweetness. Under her eyes lay a deeper
flush like that sometimes seen on a child&#39;s face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span>
after a first day&#39;s sunburn by the waterside in
springtime. Her own face might have been
called the face of four crescents. Two of the
crescents you always saw&mdash;her eyebrows, twin
down-curved bands of palest gold. In order to
see the other crescents, you had only to tell
Elizabeth some story. As you finished, she who
had been leaning over toward you slowly closed
her eyes and drew in a breath as though to drink
the last delight of it; her thin lips parted tightly
across her pointed little teeth in a smile of
thanks; and then in each cheek a curved dimple
came out, shaped like what the farmers in Elizabeth&#39;s
country call &quot;a dry moon&quot; when it appears
thus set up on end in the evening sky&mdash;the
water for the month having all run out.</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth&#39;s nose did not appear to have originated
in the New World, but to be one of those
steep Lombard noses, which on the faces of
northern Italians seem to have started down
the Alps in a landslide, to have gone a certain
distance toward the Mediterranean, and then
suddenly to have disappeared over the precipice
of the chin. Across the Alpine nose was stretched
a tiny spiderweb golden bridge: Elizabeth wore
spectacles. The frames were of the palest gold&mdash;she
insisted they must be the exact color of
her eyebrows.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>
It was the glasses perhaps that gave to her
face its look of dreaminess. But there were
times when her eyes pained. (All the doctors
had never been able to keep them from paining.)
And this often compelled her to sit with them
closed and do nothing; then her face became
dreamier. But always the look bespoke an introspection
of happiness. It drew your mind
back to the work of those unknown artisans of
Tanagra, who centuries before our era expressed
in little terra-cotta figures the freedom and joy
of Greek children in the old Greek life. Whatever
the children are doing, they are happy about
it; if they are doing nothing, they are happy
about doing nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus, as long as Elizabeth&#39;s eyes were open on
the world, they found the things that made her
happy, neglecting the rest. No psyche winging
the wide plain ever went more surely to its
needed blossom, disregarding otherwise the
crowded acres. And when her tired eyes were
closed and the golden bridge was lifted off the
Lombard nose, they were opened upon an inner
world as enchanting. For with that gift which
belongs to childhood and to genius alone, as the
real things of life which she had loved disappeared,
she caught them alive and transferred
them to another land. There also she kept all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
the other beautiful things that had never been
real on the earth but ought to have been real,
as she insisted; and on these Elysian Fields her
spirit went to play. She was already old
enough to realize that she was constantly outgrowing
things; but as they were borne backward
into the distance she turned and laid her
fingers on her lips in farewell to them&mdash;little
Niobe of unshed tears over life&#39;s changes. Her
soul seemed to be this, that she could not turn
against anything she once had loved, nor cease
to be loyal to it after it was ruined or gone. As
a swallow remembers the eaves whether the
skies be bright or dark, the nature of Elizabeth
sheltered itself under the old world&#39;s roof of
love.</p>

<p class="indent">It was this intense fidelity of character that
now kept her in her watch at the window, waiting
for the two friends who were to make them
four children on Christmas Eve. Once, indeed,
as no figures were to be seen far or near out on
the winter landscape, she turned softly into the
room, and much against her will continued her
search for the key that would unlock the doors
connecting the library with the parlor&mdash;the
dark and suddenly mysterious parlor where the
Christmas Tree now stood.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a mingling of three odors in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg&nbsp;219]</span>
library that forenoon. Into one wall an old
white marble mantel-piece was built, decorated
on each side with huge bunches of grapes&mdash;a
votive offering by Bacchus, god of the inner
fire, to Pluto, god of the outer fire. This mantel
now held in its heart a crimson glow of anthracite
coals; and the wintry smell of coal gas was
comfortably pervasive. Making its summer-like
way through the gas was the fragrance of
rose geranium, some pots of which were blooming
on a window-sill just inside the silvery landscapes
of frost. A third and more powerful
odor was that of a bruised evergreen, boughs of
which had been crushed in handling, and the sap
of which, oozing from the trunk, scattered far
its wild balsam: the fragrance ever suggested
the fir in the next room.</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth went first to the mantel, and putting
one little freckled hand on the Parian marble,
and a little freckled (perhaps) foot on the brass
fender, and pressing her side against the Bacchic
grapes (which might well have become purpling
at the moment), she opened the clock and looked
in. The clock key was there, and Elizabeth
was used to see her mother take it out for the
winding of the hours&mdash;always the winding of
the hours, the winding of the years, the winding
of life.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span>
Next she went to another window where the
geraniums were blooming, and looked on the
sill: these geraniums were her mother&#39;s especial
care, as everything in the house was her especial
care; and Elizabeth had often watched her
pouring water on the budding green of the plants
as though the drops were bright tears: once she
believed the bright drops were tears.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she passed on to the locked connecting
doors between the library and the parlor, sniffing
as she drew near the odor of the fir&mdash;sniffing it
with sensitive nostril as a fawn on some wild
mountain-side questions the breeze blowing
from beds of inaccessible herbage. Every spring
when the parlor was locked for cleaning and
when children&#39;s feet and fingers must be kept
from wet paint, she was used to see her mother
lock these doors and lay the key along the
edge of the carpet. It was not there now,
however.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Elizabeth looked in one more place.</p>

<p class="indent">The library had shelves along one wall reaching
from the floor well up toward the ceiling in
the old Southern way. Filling the shelves at
one end were the older books of the house, showing
the good but narrow taste of a Southern
household in former times. Midway, the modern
books were massed, ranging through part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
the world&#39;s classic literature and through no
little of the world&#39;s new science; and so marking
a transition in culture to the present master and
mistress. At the other end of the shelves there
was a children&#39;s corner of the world&#39;s best fairy
tales, some English, some German, some Scandinavian&mdash;most
of them written for little
people where winters are long and snows deep
and pine forests boundless.</p>

<p class="indent">She went to the shelf where the day before she
had observed her mother put a book back into
its place: the book was there, but no key. So
she passed along the shelves back toward the
window, where she maintained her lookout; and
she trailed her finger-tips along the backs of the
books as she passed the children&#39;s corner of fairy
tales: it was a habit of hers to caress things she
was fond of as long as they remained within
reach. Once her hand almost touched the key
where it lay hidden&mdash;among those old-time
Christmas stories.</p>

<p class="indent">Half glad that her search had been in vain,
she returned to her vigil at the window.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you find the key?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; and I&#39;m not sorry I didn&#39;t.&quot; And
then she suddenly cried: &quot;They are coming,
Harold! I see them away off on the hilltop
yonder, running and jumping.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>
The boy sat up on the edge of the sofa. He
had on a suit of cassimere of a kind of blue-limestone
gray as though the rock of the land had
been used as a dye; and the brass buttons of his
jacket marked him as a member of some military
institute, which had released him for the holidays.
He laid aside his Book of the World&#39;s
Great Battles, and put the hair out of his eyes.
They had the bold keenness of a hawk&#39;s; and
his profile was as sharply cut as though it had
been chipped along the edge of a white flint.</p>

<p class="indent">Any historian of the main stock of our early
American people would have fixed curious eyes
on him. Merely to behold him was to think
backward across oceans and ages to a race
emerging into notice along the coast of the
yellow-surging North Sea: known already to
their historians for straight blond hair falling
over bluish gray eyes; large bodies with shapely
white limbs; braggart voices, arrogant tempers;
play-loving and fight-loving dispositions; ingrained
honor and valor: their animal natures
rooted in attachment to their country; and
their spiritual natures soaring away toward
an ideal of truth and strength set somewhere
in a heaven. He was an offshoot of this old
race, breeding stubbornly true on these late
Kentucky fields.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span>
&quot;They are coming! They are coming at
last!&quot; cried Elizabeth, beckoning to him.</p>

<p class="indent">The boy got up and strolled over to the
window and stood beside his sister, most unlike
her: he springing from the land as rank as its
corn; she being without a country, a little
winged soul wandering through the universe,
that merely by means of birth had alighted on
Kentucky ground. At this moment beside the
grave one-toned figure of her brother the many-colored
nature of Elizabeth had its counterpart
in the picture she offered to the eye; for the sunlight
out of doors falling on the frost-jewelled
window-panes spun a silvery radiance about the
golden-red of the wind-woven hair, heightened
the transparency of her skin, and stroked with
softest pencil her little frock of forget-me-not
blue. Had she been lifted to the window-frame,
she would have looked like some portrait of herself
done in stained glass&mdash;all atmosphered with
seraphic brilliancy. As to the forget-me-not
frock, everything that Elizabeth wore seemed
to cherish her; her dresses bloomed about her
thin, unbeautiful figure like flowers bent on hiding
it, trained there by a mother&#39;s watchfulness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now I am perfectly happy,&quot; she murmured,
pressing her face fondly against his. &quot;I was
afraid it would be too cold for them to come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span>
The boy pushed her away, and placed his eye
at the small clear spot on the window-pane.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Elizabeth,&quot; he said, squinting critically, &quot;if
this is the best spy-glass you have, you would
make very little headway with the enemy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t have to make headway with the
enemy!&quot; cried Elizabeth, rejecting his hostile
utterance; &quot;I merely wished to see my friends.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The boy kept his eye at the lookout.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Elsie has on a red woollen helmet; and she
looks as though she were dyed in gore. I wish
it were old William&#39;s gore!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The sight of those far-off figures dancing
toward her had awaked in Elizabeth an ecstasy,
and she began to weave light-footed measures
of her own.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now I am perfectly happy,&quot; she sang, but
rather to herself as she whirled round the
room.</p>

<p class="indent">Her brother turned toward her and propped
his back against the window and folded his
arms: he looked like a dwarf who had been a
major-general and was conscious of it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll not be happy until that key is found.
I don&#39;t propose to be defeated.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Harold, why can&#39;t we leave everything
as it has always been, if <i>they</i> want it! If papa
and mamma wish to have one more old-fashioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
Christmas,&mdash;and you know it&#39;s the last,&mdash;if
they wish to have one more, so do I and so do
you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t pretend, Elizabeth: they needn&#39;t
ask me to pretend.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth began to dance toward him with
fairy beautiful mockery:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You just pretended you were dead on the
battle-field, among your soldiers: you just pretended
the moon was shining. You just pretended
Elsie had on a red woollen helmet. You
just pretended you were fighting William the
Conqueror. Oh, no! It is impossible for you
to pretend, you poor deficient child!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s different, Elizabeth. That&#39;s not pretending;
that&#39;s imagining. You knew it wasn&#39;t
true: there wasn&#39;t any secret about it:
it didn&#39;t fool anybody. But this pretending
about Christmas and about how things get on
the Tree, and that idiotic old buffoon!&mdash;that&#39;s
trying to make us believe it is true when it is
not true; and that it is real when it is not real!
That&#39;s the way fathers and mothers raise their
little immigrants!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth danced before him more wildly,
watching him with love and beautiful laughter:
&quot;So when papa says he is Santa Claus, he is
pretending! And when you say you are King
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
Harold, you&#39;re imagining! Why, what a bright
child you are! How <i>did</i> you ever get to be a
member of <i>this</i> dull family?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t expect you to understand the difference,
because you girls are used to doing
both&mdash;you girls! How could you know the
difference between imagining and pretending&mdash;you
girls! When you are always doing both&mdash;you
girls!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, what superior creatures we must be,
to do so much more than boys,&quot; sang Elizabeth.
Her head was filled with fragments of nursery
ditties; and the occasion seemed to warrant
the production of one. With her eyes resting
on him, she made a little dance in his honor and
at his expense; and she cadenced her footfalls
to the rhythm of her words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">The innocent lambs!&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i4">They have no shams,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And they&#39;ve nothing but wool to hide them.</span><br />
<span class="i4">They cannot pretend</span><br />
<span class="i4">Because at one end</span><br />
<span class="i0">They&#39;ve nothing but tails to guide them.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">She suddenly glided forward step by step,
airy sylph of unearthly joy, and threw her arms
around his neck and covered his face with
kisses, and then darted away from him again,
dancing. With his arms folded he looked at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
her as a stone mile-post might have looked at a
ruby-throated humming-bird.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You promised,&quot; he said&mdash;&quot;you promised
that we&#39;d find the key, and that all four of us
would walk in on them to-night. But what do
<i>you</i> know about keeping promises&mdash;you girls!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll keep my promise, but I hope I won&#39;t find
the key,&quot; said Elizabeth, as her dance grew
wilder with the rising whirlwind of expectation.
&quot;But why shouldn&#39;t papa and mamma have one
more Christmas as <i>they</i> wish it! Of course we
can&#39;t care as much for old times as they do;
but be reasonable, Harold!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t be reasonable that way. Haven&#39;t
they always told us never to pretend? Haven&#39;t
they always taught us not to have secrets?
Haven&#39;t they always said that a house with a
secret in it wasn&#39;t a good home for children?
Why can&#39;t Christmas be as open as all out
of doors? Isn&#39;t that what they call being
American&mdash;to be as open as all out of doors?
It&#39;s the little immigrants who have secrets in
them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At that moment there was a sound of feet,
muffled with yarn stockings, stamping triumphantly
on the porch.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, there they are!&quot; cried Elizabeth, darting
out of the room to receive her guests.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
More slowly the gray-toned little figure with the
white hair falling over his hawk eyes and with
the profile of white flint followed her.</p>

<p class="indent">And three great spirits there were that walked
with the lad that day&mdash;as with thousands of
other lads like him: the spirit of his race,
the spirit of his land, and the spirit of his
house.</p>

<p class="indent">The real darkness of the Middle Ages was the
spiritual night that settled upon children as they
began to play about their homes and to ask the
meanings of them&mdash;why they were built as they
were&mdash;and the meaning of other things they
saw in them and around them. The architects
of those centuries designed their noblest buildings
often with an eye to many of the worst
passions of human nature. Toiling masons
slowly put into mortar and stone exact arrangements
for the violent and the vile: they built
not for the good in human character, but against
evil&mdash;not for a heaven on earth, but against a
hell on earth. When the owners took possession,
they had placed between themselves and
the surrounding world the strongest possible
proofs of a hostile and vicious attitude. Even
within their homes they had fortified one intimate
part against another intimate part until it was
as though the ventricles of the human heart had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
walled themselves in distrust away from the
auricles.</p>

<p class="indent">The mental and moral gloom of such homes
hung destructively, appallingly over children.
The very architecture taught them their first
bad lessons. Lifted in their nurse&#39;s or mother&#39;s
arms, they peered from parapet down upon drawbridge
and moat&mdash;at danger. At the entrances
they saw massive doors built to shut out death,
perhaps battle-hacked, blood-stained. From
these they learned violence and the habit of killing.
Trap-doors taught them treachery. Sliding-panels
in walls taught them cunning, flight, and
cowardice, eaves-dropping. Underground dungeons
taught them revenge, cruelty, persecution
to the death: they might look down into one and
see lying there some victim of slow starvation
or slow torture. Nearly every leading vicious
trait born in them seized upon the house itself
for development, and began to clamber up its
walls as naturally as castle ivy.</p>

<p class="indent">Little children of the Dark Ages!&mdash;does any
one now ever try to enter into their terrors and
troubles and warped souls? Can any one conceivably
nowadays look out upon human life or
up to the heavens through their vision!</p>

<p class="indent">When the Anglo-Saxon, heaven&#39;s blue in his
eyes, sunlight in his hair, the conquest of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span>
future in his brain, the peopling of the future in
his loins, breasted fresh waters and reached the
distant shore, he had come to a great land where
he could build for the best that was in him.
The story of the black slave fleeing across a
Western river from a slave state into a free
state, thrilling millions in this country, is as
nothing to the story of the White Slave of the
Ages who escaped across an ocean into a world
where he became a free man. The cabins of
this New World became the nurseries of a new
kind of childhood on the earth. There is no
possibility of measuring the effect upon a child
and upon the man he is to be even of a door that
has no lock and of windows that have no shutters.
It was while sleeping behind such undefended
doors and windows that the gaunt mated lions
and lionesses on the Western frontiers of this
Republic bred in chaste passion their lean
cubs. Out of such a cabin without a bolt and
with its mere latchstring there walked forth a
new type of American man, the Nation&#39;s man,
who as a child had trusted the open door in his
father&#39;s house, and as a man trusted the door
of humanity: nor had within himself secret nor
secrecy, nor trick nor guile, nor double-dealing
nor cruelty, nor vindictiveness nor revenge&mdash;the
naked American, unpollutable iron of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
strength and honor, Child of the New Childhood,
Man of the New Manhood, with the
great silence in him that is in the Great.</p>

<p class="indent">The birthplace of Harold and Elizabeth was
one of the thousands and thousands of plain
American homes in Kentucky and elsewhere that
are the breeding-grounds and fortresses of the
Republic&#39;s impregnable virtue. The house had
never taught them a bad lesson; it had never
offered them an architectural trait to which their
own coarser human traits could attach themselves.
It had never uttered a suggestion that
there is anything wrong in the human nature
dwelling within it or human nature approaching
it from without. It was built against one
enemy&mdash;the climate. And whenever the climate
began war on the house, the children had
a chance to see how well prepared for war it
was: the climate always retreated, whipped in
the end.</p>

<p class="indent">Their land was like their birthplace. The
earliest generations of little white Kentuckians
had good reason to dread their country&mdash;no
children anywhere ever had more. It was their
Dark Ages. Death encompassed them. Torture
snatched them from the breast. Terror
cradled them. But all that was good and great
in their parents fought on their side; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
through the Dark Ages of the West shone the
lustre of a new chivalry.</p>

<p class="indent">But all that was changed long ago&mdash;changed
except to history; and to gratitude which is the
memory of the heart. On these plains of Kentucky
no wildness any more, nothing unknown
lurking anywhere: a deep strong land completely
gentled but not weakened; over it drifting the
lights and shadows of tranquil skies; and
throbbing always in the heart of it a passion of
tenderness that draws its wandering children
back across all distances and through all years.</p>

<p class="indent">Ay, there were three great spirits that walked
with the lad that day and with the uncounted
army of his peers; the spirit of their race&mdash;the
old Anglo-Saxon race that has made its best
share of the world&#39;s history by cutting away
with its sword the rotting curtains that conceal
sham and superstition; the spirit of his country
which moves with resistless strength toward
the real and the strong; and the spirit of the
plain American home&mdash;that fortress where the
real and the ideal meet.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span></p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p class="h2">FOUR IN A CAGE</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> four children early that afternoon were
shut in the library with instructions from the
mother of the household: it was too cold to go
out of doors any more&mdash;this was given as
gentle counsel to the visitors; their father&mdash;here
the head was shaken warningly at the other
two&mdash;their father was finishing some very
important work in his library and must not be
disturbed by noises; she herself could not be with
them longer because&mdash;her eyes spoke volumes
of delightful mysteries, a volume that suggested
preparations for the coming Night. So they
must entertain themselves with whatever was
within reach: there were games, there were
books; especially wonderful old Christmas
tales. They must not forget to read from
these. Finally she summed up: they must
remember in whatever they did and whatever
they said that they were American children
playing on Christmas Eve&mdash;the last of the
Kentucky Christmas Eves in that house!</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span>
The children thought, at least Elsie thought,
that they would have a better time if they were
allowed to be simply children instead of American
children: and she said so. She was of the opinion
that being American interfered a good deal with
being natural. But the rejoinder, made with graciousness
and responsive humor, was that the
American back was fitted to the burden and that
no doubt the burden was fitted to the back: at
least they could try it and see&mdash;and the door
was softly closed.</p>

<p class="indent">The children gathered almost immediately
about a centre-table on which were books and
many magazines, very modern and very American
magazines, which were pleasantly lighted
of evenings by a reading-lamp. The two children
who were at home were much used to catching
echoes from those magazines as expounded and
discussed by mature heads. What attracted
them all now was neither lamp nor literature, but
a silver tray bearing plates and knives and napkins.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It looks as though we were going to have
something delicious,&quot; said Elizabeth daintily;
and she peeped under a napkin, adding with
disappointment: &quot;O dear! I am afraid it is
going to be fruit!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Even as she spoke there was a knock on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span>
door as though something had been delayed, and
the door was reopened far enough to admit the
maternal hand grasping the handle of a massive
old fruit basket piled with apples. There was a
rush to the door, and another protest: &quot;Only
apples, and there are barrels of them in the cellar:
why not potatoes and be done with it! Entertain
one&#39;s company on apples!&quot; But the door
was closed firmly, and thus the situation appeared
to settle down for the rest of the afternoon.</p>

<p class="indent">It soon having become a problem of whether
the apples should go to the children or the children
go to the apples, Elizabeth decided that it
should be solved in the human way; and she led
the group back to the table under guidance of
Elsie&#39;s eyes, which more than once had turned in
that direction with a delicate, not to say indelicate,
suggestion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose it is better than starving,&quot; she
remarked apologetically, adjusting her glasses
in order to find the next best apple for Herbert
after Harold had given the best to Elsie, and
as she peeled her apple, she added with some
instinct of regret that she was offering her guests
refreshments so meagre:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How much better turkey and plum pudding
sound in the old Christmas stories than they
are when you have them!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
Elsie did not agree with this view. &quot;I think
it is much better to <i>have</i> them,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But in your mind&#39;s eye&mdash;&quot; pleaded
Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know so well about that eye!&quot; said
Elsie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, but, Elsie,&quot; insisted Elizabeth with a
rising enthusiasm, &quot;in Dickens&#39; <i>Christmas Carol</i>
wouldn&#39;t you rather the big prize turkey were
whirled away in the cab to the Bob Cratchits?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must say that I should <i>not</i>,&quot; contended
Elsie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But the plum pudding, Elsie!&quot; cried Elizabeth,
now in the full glow of a beautiful ardor;
&quot;when Mrs. Cratchit brings in the plum pudding
looking like a speckled cannon-ball, hard
and firm and blazing with brandy and with
Christmas holly stuck in the top of it, wouldn&#39;t
you rather the little Cratchits ate <i>that</i>?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed I would!&quot; said Elsie; &quot;for I never
cared for that pudding; they were welcome to
it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth dropped her head and was silent;
then she murmured, in wounded loyalty to the
Cratchits: &quot;It <i>must</i> have been good! Because
Dickens said they ate all of it and wanted
more. But they tried to look as though they&#39;d
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
had quite sufficient; and I think they were
very nice about it, Elsie, for children who had
had so little training. They behaved as very
well bred, indeed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t doubt it,&quot; said Elsie. &quot;I have
nothing against their manners. And I suppose
they thought it a good pudding! I merely remarked
that <i>I</i> did <i>not</i> think it a good pudding!
They had their opinion, and I have my opinion
of that pudding.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The subject was abandoned, but a moment
later revived by Herbert, sitting at Elizabeth&#39;s
side:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dickens had a great many more things in
the <i>Carol</i> than the turkey and the plum pudding,&quot;
he observed, with his habit of taking in
everything; and he began with a memorized list
of the <i>Carol&#39;s</i> Christmas luxuries in one heap&mdash;passing
from geese to punch. &quot;I always like
Dickens: he gives you plenty,&quot; he concluded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, bother!&quot; said Harold, the Kentucky
Saxon whose forefathers had been immigrants
from Dickens&#39; land. &quot;We have everything in
Kentucky that they had, and more besides.
They can keep their Dickens!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, but Harold,&quot; pleaded Elizabeth, &quot;we
haven&#39;t any American Christmas stories! Not
one old fairy tale&mdash;not one!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span>
&quot;We don&#39;t want any old English fairy tales.
American children don&#39;t want fairy tales.
Couldn&#39;t we have them if we wanted them? I
should say so. Can&#39;t we make anything in our
country that we want?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But the little Cratchits, Harold!&quot; insisted
Elizabeth, &quot;we do want the little Cratchits!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have plenty of American Cratchits just
as good&mdash;and much worse.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The eating of the apples now went on silently,
Elizabeth having been worsted in her battle for
the Cratchits. But soon as hostess she made
another effort to be charming.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mamma tells us that whenever we have
anything very very good, we must always remember
to leave a little for Lazarus. Especially
at Christmas&mdash;we must remember to share
with Lazarus&mdash;to leave something on our plates
for him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; said Elsie, &quot;Herbert and I have
always been taught to leave something on our
plates for good manners. But I never heard
good manners called Lazarus. I didn&#39;t suppose
Lazarus had any manners!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth&#39;s face and neck was colored with
a quick flame, and she bent her head over her
plate until her hair covered her eyes. She undertook
an explanation:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
&quot;I think I know what mamma meant, Elsie.
Mamma always means a great deal. It was this
way: long, long ages ago all over the world
people had to divide with imaginary beings:
every year they had to give so much, part of
everything they owned. Then by and by&mdash;I
don&#39;t know the exact date, Elsie, dear, and I
don&#39;t think it makes much difference; but by
and by there weren&#39;t any more imaginary beings.
Mamma said that they all disappeared, going
down the road of the world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But who got all the things?&quot; asked Elsie.
&quot;The imaginary beings didn&#39;t get them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose that is another story,&quot; said Elizabeth,
who was determined this time not to be
browbeaten. &quot;Then just as they all disappeared
down the road, from the opposite direction there
came the figure of a man&mdash;Lazarus. Of course
I can&#39;t tell it as mamma explains it to me, but
this is what it comes to: that for ages and ages
people were compelled to give up a share of what
they had to imaginary beings; but now there
aren&#39;t any imaginary beings, and we must divide
with people we actually see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t actually see Lazarus,&quot; said Elsie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But with your mind&#39;s eye&mdash;!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, <i>that</i> eye&mdash;!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mamma thought she would give us a good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
send-off for Christmas Eve,&quot; murmured Elizabeth
with another wound: she had been as
unfortunate in her crusade for Lazarus as she
had been with her tirade for the Cratchits.</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie and Harold had pushed back their chairs
and frolicked away to a distant part of the room
to an unfinished game of backgammon. Elizabeth
dipped her fingers into her finger-bowl, and
with admiration watched Elsie in her beauty
and bouncing proportions: for she was a beautiful
child&mdash;with the beauty of round healthy
vegetables displayed on market stalls, causing you
to feel comfortable and human. As for Elizabeth,
her thinness had been her pathos: from
earliest childhood she had been made to realize
on school playgrounds and in all juvenile companies
that very thin children win no kind of
leadership: with an instinct sure and no doubt
wise, children uniformly give their suffrages to the
fat, and vote by the pound. Now she looked
longingly at the bewitching vision of her opposite&mdash;at
the heavy braids of chestnut hair hanging
down the broad back and tied with a bit of blue-checked
ribbon&mdash;a back that would have made
three of her backs. One day while being dressed
by her mother she had remarked regarding
herself that she was glad she was no longer:
she might be taken for the sea-serpent.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span>
Elsie was dressed in a shade of brown that
suggested a blend of the colors of good morning
coffee with Durham cream in it and Kentucky
waffles: a kind of general breakfast brown.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Elizabeth&#39;s glance came home to Herbert
at her side. He was dressed in much the
same shade of brown. But something in his
nature transmuted this, and he rather seemed
clad in a raiment that suggested spun oak leaves
as in autumn they lie at the bottom of still
pools when the blue of the sky falls on them and
chill winds pass low. Her tenderness suddenly
enfolded him: it was the first time he had ever
come to stay all night: it gave her an intimate
sense of proprietorship in him. She settled down
into her chair&mdash;the large, high-backed, parental
chair&mdash;and began rather plaintively&mdash;but also
not without stratagem&mdash;having first looked
quickly to see that Elsie was at a safe distance:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mamma says that if you have red hair
and are born ugly, and grow uglier, and are very
thin, and are named Elizabeth, and no one loves
you, you may become a very dangerous person.
She&#39;s positive that was the trouble with Queen
Elizabeth. Some day it may be natural for
me to want to cut off somebody&#39;s head&mdash;I
don&#39;t know whose yet&mdash;but <i>somebody&#39;s</i>.
Mamma and I are alike: if we were not loved,
it would be the end of us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
(To think that even this innocent child should
have had such guile!) A head of chestnut hair
was unexpectedly moved around in front of
Elizabeth&#39;s glasses and a pair of eyes peeped
in through those private windows: peeped&mdash;disappeared.
From the other chair a voice
sounded, becoming confidential:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some time before you are grown, Elizabeth,
some one is going to tell you something.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish I knew what it was <i>now</i>!&quot; murmured
Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will know when the time comes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t see why the time doesn&#39;t come
now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Before you are grown?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s the same thing&mdash;I <i>feel</i> grown&mdash;for
the moment!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth looked around again to see where
Elsie was.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;d like to ask you a question, Elizabeth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should be pleased to answer the question.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But father told me not to ask any questions:
I was to wait till I got back home and ask <i>him</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think that is very strange! Aren&#39;t there
questions a boy can&#39;t ask his father? A father
wouldn&#39;t be the right one to answer. You must
ask the one who can answer!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was no reply.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span>
&quot;Well,&quot; urged Elizabeth, feeling the time
was short (there have been others!), &quot;if you can&#39;t
<i>ask</i> it, <i>pop</i> it! If you can&#39;t ask the question,
pop the question.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And then&mdash;clandestinely down behind the
backs of the chairs! And not on the cheek!
Exact style of the respondent not accurately
known&mdash;probably early Elizabethan.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Toward the middle of the afternoon as they
played further about the room in search of
whatever entertainment it afforded, they
stopped before an old cabinet with shelves
arranged behind glass doors.</p>

<p class="indent">On one of the upper shelves stood some little
oval frames of blue or of rose-colored velvet;
and in the frames were miniatures of women of
old Southern days with bare ivory necks and
shoulders and perhaps a big damask rose on the
breast or pendent in a cataract of curls behind
the ear: women who made you think what must
have been the physical and mental calibre of
the men who had captured them and held them
captured: Elizabeth&#39;s grandmothers and aunts
on the mother&#39;s side. The two girls, each with
an arm around the other&#39;s waist and heads close
together, peered through the glass doors at the
vital dames.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t they look as though they liked to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg&nbsp;244]</span>
dance and to eat and to manage everything and
everybody?&quot; said Elsie, always practical.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t they look <i>proud</i>!&quot; said Elizabeth
proudly, &quot;and <i>true</i>! and don&#39;t they look <i>alive</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But she linked her arm in Elsie&#39;s and drew
her away to something else, adding in delicate
confidence: &quot;I think I am glad, though, Elsie,
that mamma does not look like <i>them</i>. There
is no one in the world like mamma! I am a little
like her, but I dwindled. Children <i>do</i> dwindle
nowadays, don&#39;t they?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not I,&quot; said Elsie. &quot;I didn&#39;t dwindle. Do
you notice any dwindling anywhere about me?
Please say where.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On the middle and lower shelves of the cabinet
were some long-ago specimens of mounted wild
duck; and on the moss-ragged boughs of an
artificial oak some age-moulted passenger pigeons.
The boys talked about these, and told
stories of their grandfathers&#39; hunting days when
pigeons in multitudes flecked the morning sky
on frosty mornings or had made blue feathery
clouds about the oak trees in the vast Kentucky
pastures.</p>

<p class="indent">Following this lead, the boys went to the
book-shelves, and taking down a volume of Audubon&#39;s
great folio work on <i>American Birds</i>, they
spread it open on the carpet and, sprawling before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
it, found the picture of the vanished wild
pigeon there, and began to read about him.</p>

<p class="indent">Observing this, Elizabeth and Elsie took
down a volume of the same great man&#39;s work
on <i>American Animals</i>; and with it open before
them on the floor a few yards away, facing the
boys, they began to turn the pages, looking
indifferently for whatever beasts might appear.</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth&#39;s peculiar interest in animal pictures
had begun during the summer previous, when
the family were having a vacation trip in Europe.
Upon her visits to galleries of paintings she
had repeatedly encountered the same picture:
The Manger with the Divine Child as the centre
of the group; and about the Child, half in
shadow, the donkey and others of his lowly
fellows of the stall&mdash;all turned in brute adoration.
The memory of these Christmas pictures
came vividly back to her now&mdash;especially the
face of the donkey who was always made to look
as though he had long been expecting the event;
and whereas reasonably gratified, could not
definitely say that he was much surprised: his
entire aspect being that of a creature too meek
and lowly to think that anything foreseen by him
could possibly be much of a miracle.</p>

<p class="indent">Once also she had seen another animal picture
that fascinated her: it represented a blond-haired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg&nbsp;246]</span>
little girl of about her own age, with bare
feet, hair hanging down, a palm branch in her
hand. She was escorted by a troop of wild
animals, each vying with the other in attempt
to convince this exceptional little girl that
nothing could induce them just at present to be
carnivorous.</p>

<p class="indent">The most dangerous beasts walked at the
head of the line; the less powerful took their
places in the rear; and the procession gradually
tapered off in the distance until only the smallest
creatures were to be seen struggling resolutely
along in the parade. The meaning of the picture
seemed to be that nothing harmful could
come from the animal kingdom on this particular
day, providing the animals were allowed to
arrange themselves as specified in the procession.
What might have happened on the day preceding
or the day following was not guaranteed;
nor what might have befallen the little girl on
this day if she had not been a blonde; nor what
might overtake little boys, dark or fair, at any
time. This picture also was in Elizabeth&#39;s
memory as she turned Audubon&#39;s mighty pages;
but somehow no American animals seemed to
be represented in it: probably absenting themselves
through the American desire&mdash;ranging
through the whole animal kingdom&mdash;not to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span>
appear sentimental. All, no doubt, would have
been glad to parade behind Elizabeth; but
they must have agreed that only the sheep in
the United States has the right to look sheepish.</p>

<p class="indent">The boys, sitting behind the <i>Birds</i>, and the
girls sitting behind the <i>Quadrupeds</i>, turned the
leaves and began to toss their comments and
their fun back and forth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The wild pigeon is gone,&quot; said Harold, whose
ideas on this subject and others related to it
showed that he had listened with a good purpose
to a father who was a naturalist and patriotic
American. &quot;The wild pigeon is gone, and the
buffalo is gone, and the deer is going, and all the
other big game is gone or is going, and the birds
are going, and the forests are going, and the
streams are going, and the Americans are going:
everything is going but the immigrants&mdash;they
are coming.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, but, Harold, we were immigrants once,&quot;
admitted Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We were Anglo-Saxon immigrants,&quot; said
the son of his father; &quot;and they&#39;re the only kind
for this country. If all the rest of the country
were like Kentucky, it wouldn&#39;t be so bad. And
we American boys have got to get busy when we
are men, or there won&#39;t be any real Americans
left: I expect to stand for a big family, I do,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg&nbsp;248]</span>
he affirmed to Herbert as though he somehow
appropriated the privilege and the glory of it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So do I intend to stand for a big family,&quot;
replied Herbert quickly and jealously, now that
matters seemed to be on a satisfactory basis
with Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We boys are going to do our part,&quot; called
out the Anglo-Saxon to the girls sitting opposite.
&quot;You American girls will have to do yours!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We shall be quite ready,&quot; Elizabeth sang
back dreamily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We shall be ready,&quot; echoed Elsie, not to be
excluded from her full share in future proceedings,
&quot;and we shall be much pleased to be
ready!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The boys turning the pages of the <i>Birds</i> had
reached the picture of the American robin redbreast;
and the girls turning the pages of the
<i>Quadrupeds</i> had reached the picture of the
American rabbit; Elizabeth was softly stroking
its ears and coat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think,&quot; said Herbert, looking across at
Elizabeth, and also of that cordial lusty household
bird whose picture was before him, &quot;I
think that if a real American were to begin at
twenty and keep on until he was, say, ninety,
he&#39;d be able to down the immigrants with a
family.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg&nbsp;249]</span>
&quot;Why ninety?&quot; inquired Elizabeth, looking
tenderly back at him and apparently disturbed
by the fixing of an arbitrary limit.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s all the Bible allows; then you take a
rest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, then our family didn&#39;t want any rest,&quot;
exclaimed Harold; &quot;for grandfather had a
child when he was ninety-one: isn&#39;t that so,
Elizabeth?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Harold! You&#39;ve got that wrong. It
wasn&#39;t grandmother, you dear lamb! Wasn&#39;t
it a woman in the Old Testament&mdash;Sarah&mdash;or
Hagar&mdash;or maybe Rebecca?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anyhow, I&#39;m right about grandfather! I&#39;m
positive he had one. Hurrah for grandfather!
He was the right kind of American! When
I&#39;m a man, I&#39;ll be the right kind: I&#39;ll have
the largest family in this neighborhood.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t say that! Take that back!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I <i>will</i> say it, and I do say it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then&mdash;take&mdash;<i>that</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The member of the military institute received
a slap in the mouth from a masculine overgrown
hand which caused him to measure the length
of his spine backward on a large damask rose
in the velvet carpet.</p>

<p class="indent">They fought as two young males should, one
of whom had recently imagined himself the last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
of the Saxon kings and the other of whom had
realized himself as an accepted lover. They
fought for a moment over the priceless folio
of Audubon and ruined those open pages where
the robin, family-bird of the yards, had innocently
brought on the fray. They fought round
the room, past furniture and over it: Elsie following
with delight and wishing that each would be
well punished; Elizabeth following in despair,
broken-hearted lest either should be worsted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The idea of two brats fighting over which
is going to have the largest family!&quot; cried the
former.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Harold, Harold, Harold!&quot; implored
Elizabeth. &quot;To fight in your own house!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where could I fight if I didn&#39;t fight in my
own house?&quot; shouted the Saxon. &quot;I couldn&#39;t
fight in his.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; you can fight in mine&mdash;whenever
you&#39;ve a mind!&quot; shouted his hospitable foe.</p>

<p class="indent">Then something intervened&mdash;miraculously.
The boys had reached the farther end of the
library and the locked doors. There they had
clinched again, and there they went down sidewise
with a heavy fall against those barriers.
As they started to their feet to close in again,
the miracle took place&mdash;a real miracle, and
most appropriate to Christmas Eve. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>
Middle Ages such a miracle would have given
rise to a legend, a saint, a shrine, and relics.</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth, who had hung upon the edge of
battle, was the first to see it. As her brother
rose, she threw herself upon him and whispered:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, look, Harold! Now you&#39;ll stop!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Through the large empty keyhole of the
locked doors an object was making its way:
first one long green finger appeared, and then a
second, and then a third&mdash;those three sacred
fingers&mdash;as old as Buddha! They made their
way into the air of the library, followed by a
foot or more of timber; and the fingers and arm
taken together constituted a broken-off bough
of the Christmas Tree: sign of peace and good
will on earth on that Eve: a true modern
miracle!</p>

<p class="indent">But the member of the military institute did
not see it in that light; what it suggested to
him was the memory of certain green twigs that
in earlier years had played stingingly around
a pair of bare disobedient legs&mdash;wanton disturbers
of common household peace; and as he
stood there remembering, his recollection was
further assisted by certain minatory movements
of the sacred bough itself in the keyhole&mdash;a
reminder that the same hand was now at the
end of the switch. It was not the miraculous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg&nbsp;252]</span>
that persuaded him: it was the much too
natural! But then is not the natural in such
a case miraculous enough? To take a small
green cylinder of vegetable tissue and apply it
to a larger unclad cylinder of animal tissue, with
a spasmodic contraction of muscular tissue, and
get a moral result from the gray matter of the
distant brain: is not that miraculous enough?
If people must hunt for miracles and must have
them, can they not find all they want in the
natural?</p>

<p class="indent">There was stillness in the library as that green
bough slowly disappeared. The rabbit and
the robin, the latter badly torn, got put back
upon the shelves in their respective volumes.
And presently there was nothing more to be
seen but four laughing children.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">And now it was getting late. Outside and
all over the land snow was falling&mdash;the longed-for
snow of Christmas Eve. And the last thing
to chronicle regarding the afternoon was a
reading.</p>

<p class="indent">The little gray-toned lad with the mop of
whitish hair and the profile of white flint had
straggled back to the story which had absorbed
him earlier that day&mdash;The Book of the World&#39;s
Great Battles; and he had read to his listeners
seated around him the story of the sad battle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg&nbsp;253]</span>
of Hastings when Saxon Harold fell, and green
Saxon England with its mighty throne was lost
to fair-haired Saxon men and women&mdash;for a
long, sad time.</p>

<p class="indent">This boy was living very close to the mind
of a father who was watching the history of his
country; and his own brain was full of small
echoes, which perhaps did not echo very fully
and truly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is the kind of battle we are going
to fight,&quot; he said. &quot;England had to fight her
immigrants, and we some day shall have to fight
our immigrants! Because they <i>will</i> bring into
our country old things from their old countries,
and we won&#39;t have those old things. They are
the ones that brought in this silly old Santa
Claus.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If there is a war,&quot; said the son of the doctor,
&quot;I&#39;ll be the surgeon; and I know of two salves
already&mdash;one for wounds that are open and
one for wounds that might as well be. It&#39;s a
salve that father got in France; and they may
have used it at the battle of Waterloo; that&#39;s
why there were so many soldiers limping around
afterwards.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Herbert,&quot; said Elsie, &quot;it couldn&#39;t have
been such a wonderful salve if it set everybody
to limping.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg&nbsp;254]</span>
&quot;Well, it is either limp or be dead: so they
limped.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What I like about the French,&quot; said Harold,
remembering a summer spent in France, &quot;is the
big red breeches on the soldiers: then you&#39;ve
got the gore on you all the time, whether you&#39;re
fighting or not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth&#39;s mild beam of humor saw a chance
to shine:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, but, Harold,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;they <i>are</i>
so dangerous! You know the towns were full
of soldiers, and there wasn&#39;t one in the country.
If a soldier is seen in the pastures, the French
bulls get after them! Blue is better: then you
aren&#39;t chased!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It had come Elizabeth&#39;s time to read. She
made preparations for it with the finest sense of
how beautiful an occasion it was going to be:
she hunted for the best chairs; she pushed them
together near one of the windows where the
last afternoon light from the snow-darkened sky
began to fall mystically; then she went to the
children&#39;s corner of Fairy Tales and softly
peered along the shelf; and she drew out a
well-remembered volume. Then, seating herself
before her auditors, she began in the sweetest,
most faltering of voices to read a story that in
earlier years had charmed them all.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span>
She had scarcely begun before she discovered
that she no longer had an audience: nobody
listened. Saddest of all, Elizabeth found that
she did not herself listen: she could no longer
draw close even to the boundaries of that once
magical world: it was gone from her and now
she herself loved it only as she saw it in the dim
distance&mdash;on the Elysian Fields of lost things.</p>

<p class="indent">There may have been something of import
to the future of this nation in the way in which
these four country children, crowded as it were
on a narrow headland looking toward the Past,
there said good-by for the last time to faith
in the whole literature of Fairy Land. The
splendid, the terrible race of creatures which
once had peopled the world of imagination for
races and civilizations had now crumbled to dust
at the touch of those little minds. For in the
hard white light of our New World backward,
always backward toward the cradle moves the
retreating line of faith in the old superstitions:
the shadows of the supernatural retire more
and more toward the very curtains that cradle
infancy; and it may be that the last miracle
of fable will die where it was born&mdash;on the lips
of the child.</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth&#39;s face flamed red as she shut the
book. It was dead to her; but her brain was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg&nbsp;256]</span>
musical with refrains about things that had gone
to those inner Fields of hers; and now as though
she felt herself just a little alone&mdash;even from
Herbert&mdash;she walked away to the piano:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You wouldn&#39;t listen to the story, but you&#39;ll
have to listen to a song! This is <i>my</i> song to a
Fairy&mdash;my slumber song! It is away off in
the woods, and I go all by myself to where she
is, and I sing this song to her.&quot; So Elizabeth
sang:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Over thee bright dews be shaken;</span><br />
<span class="i2">On thine eyelids violets blow;</span><br />
<span class="i0">At thy hand white stars awaken;</span><br />
<span class="i2">Past thee sun and darkness go!</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;In the world where thou art vanished,</span><br />
<span class="i2">All dear things are ever young.</span><br />
<span class="i0">I as thou will soon be vanished,</span><br />
<span class="i2">I like thee from nought am sprung.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Slumber, slumber! Why awaken?</span><br />
<span class="i2">No one now believes in thee.</span><br />
<span class="i0">I shall sleep while worlds are shaken&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i2">No one will believe in me.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">It was the poorest, most faltering, yet most
faithful voice&mdash;the mere note of a linnet long
before the singing season has begun. As it died
out, she descended from her premature perch
and went with her repudiated book to the shelves
where it must be put&mdash;not to be taken down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg&nbsp;257]</span>
again. In the shadow of the library and with
the uncertainty of her glasses, she fumbled as
she sought the place, and the volumes on each
side collapsed together. Whereupon a large key
slid from the top and fell to the floor. With
a low cry of delight&mdash;but of regret also&mdash;she
seized it and held it up:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Harold, the key! I have found it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As the others hurried to her, she said to Elsie,
as though boys were not fine enough to understand
anything so fine:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was like mamma to hide the key <i>there</i>!
She gave it to the old Christmas stories to keep
and guard!&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Soon after this the children were not seen in
the room. Some one came for them, and they
were made ready for supper. After supper they
were kept well guarded in another part of the
house; and at an earlier hour than usual the
little flock were herded up-stairs and at the top
divided along masculine and feminine by-paths
toward drowsy folds.</p>

<p class="indent">No lights were brought into the room where
they had been playing. The red embers of the
anthracite sank lower under their ashes: all was
darkness and silence for the mysteries of Christmas
Eve.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[pg&nbsp;258]</span></p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p class="h2">THE REALM OF MIDNIGHT</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">A</span> quarter of a century ago or more the
German Christmas Tree&mdash;the diffusion of
which throughout the world was begun soon
after the close of the Napoleonic wars&mdash;had
not made its way into general use throughout the
rural districts of central Kentucky. The older
Dutch and English festivals which had blent
their features into the American holiday was the
current form celebrated in blue-grass homes.
The German forest-idea had been adopted in
the towns for churches and other public festivities;
and in private houses also that were in the
van of the world-movement. But out in the
country the evergreen had not yet enriched the
great winter drama of Nature with its fresh note
of the immortal drawn from a dead world: the
evergreen was to eyes there the evergreen still,
as the primrose to other eyes had been the primrose
and nothing more.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus there was no Christmas Tree; and
Christmas Eve brought no joy to children except
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg&nbsp;259]</span>
that of waiting for Christmas morning. Not
until they went to sleep or feigned slumber; not
until fires died down in chimney-corners where
socks and stockings hung from a mantelpiece
or from the backs of maternal and paternal
chairs&mdash;not till then did the Sleigh of the White
World draw near across the landscape of darkness.
Out of its realm of silence and snow it
was suddenly there!&mdash;outside the house, laden
with gifts, drawn by tireless reindeer and driven
by its indefatigable forest-god. He was no
longer young, the driver, as was shown in his case,
quite as it is shown in the case of commoner men,
by his white beard and round ruddy middle-aged
face; but his twinkling eyes and fresh good
humor showed that the core of him was still
boyish; and apparently the one great lesson he
had learned from half a lifetime was that the best
service he could render the whole world consisted
in giving it one night of innocent happiness
and kindness. Not until well on toward
midnight was he there at the house, without
sound or signal, the Sleigh perhaps halted at
the front gate or drawn up behind aged cedar
trees in the yard; or for all that any one knew to
the contrary, resting lightly on the roof of the
house itself, or remaining poised up in the air.</p>

<p class="indent">At least on the roof <i>he</i> was: he peeked down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg&nbsp;260]</span>
the chimney to see whether the fire were out
(and he never by any mistake went to the wrong
chimney): then he scrambled hurriedly down.
If any children were in bed in the room, he tickled
the soles of their feet to prove if they were
asleep; then crammed socks and stockings;
dispersed other gifts around on the tops of furniture;
left his smile on everything to last a
year&mdash;the smile of old forgiveness and of new
affection&mdash;and was up the chimney again&mdash;back
in the Sleigh&mdash;gone! Gone to the next
house, then to the next, and on from house to
house over the neighborhood, over the nation,
over the world: the first to operate without
accidental breakdown the heavier-than-air machine,
unless it were possibly a remote American
kinswoman of his, the New England witch on
her broomstick aeroplane: which however she
was never able to travel on outside New England.
In this belting of the globe with a sleigh
in a single night he must often have come to
rivers and mountain ranges where passage was
impossible; and then it is certain that the
Sleigh was driven up to the roadway of the
clouds and travelled across the lonely stretches
of the snow before it fell.</p>

<p class="indent">Why he should come near midnight&mdash;who
ever asked such a question? Has not that hour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg&nbsp;261]</span>
always been the natural locality and resort for
the supernatural? What things merry or sorry
could ever have come to pass but for the stroke
of midnight? How could Shakespeare have
written certain dramas without the mere aid
of twelve o&#39;clock? What considerable part
of English literature would drop out of existence
but for the fact that Big Ben struck
twelve!</p>

<p class="indent">The children stood at the head of the stairs;
and the Great Night which was to climb so high
began for them low down&mdash;with the furniture.
Standing there, they listened for the sound
of any movement in the house: there was none,
and they began to descend. Stairways in homesteads
built as solid as that did not give way
with any creaking of timbers under the pressure
of feet; and they were thickly carpeted. Half
way down the children leaned over the banisters
and listened again.</p>

<p class="indent">Here at the turning of the stairway, directly
below, there lived in his pointed weather-house
the old Time-Sentinel of the family, who with
his one remaining arm saluted evermore backward
and forward in front of his stiff form;
and at every swing of this limb you could hear
his muscle crack in his ancient shoulder-joint.
A metallic salute which the children had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg&nbsp;262]</span>
accustomed to all their lives was one of the only two
sounds that now reached them.</p>

<p class="indent">The other sound came from near him: sitting
on the hall carpet on a square rug of tin especially
provided for her was the winter companion
of the time-piece&mdash;a large round mica-plated
anthracite stove&mdash;middle-aged, designing,
and corpulent. This seeming stove, whose
puffed flushed cheeks now reflected an unusual
excitement, gave out little comfortable wooing
sounds, all confidential and travelling in a soft
volley toward the sentinel, backed gaunt and taciturn
against the wall.</p>

<p class="indent">The children of the house had long ago named
this pair the Cornered Soldier and the Marrying
Stove; and they explained the positions of the
two as indicating that the stove had backed the
veteran into the corner and had sat largely down
before him with the determination to remain
there until she had warmed him up to the
proper response. The veteran however devoted
his existence to moving his arm back and forth
to ward off her infatuation, and meanwhile he
persisted in muttering in his loudest possible
monotone: <i>Go away&mdash;keep off! Go away&mdash;keep
off! Go away&mdash;keep off!</i> There were
seasons of course when the stove became less
ardent, for even with the fibre of iron such pursuits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg&nbsp;263]</span>
must relax sometimes; but the veteran
never permitted his arm to stop waving, trusting
her least when she was cold&mdash;rightly enough!</p>

<p class="indent">At the foot of the stairway they encountered
a pair of objects that were genuinely alive.
Two aged setters with gentle eyes and gentle ears
and gentle dispositions rose from where they lay
near the stove, came around, and, putting their
feet on the lowest step, stretched themselves
backward with a low bow, and then, leaning
forward with softly wagging tails, they pushed
their noses against the two children of the house,
inquiring why they were out of bed at that unheard-of
hour: they offered their services. But
being shoved aside, they returned to their
places and threw themselves down again&mdash;not
curled inward with chilliness, but flat on the side
with noses pointed outward: they were not
wholly reassured, and the ear of one was thrown
half back, leaving the auditory channel uncurtained:
they had no fear, but they felt solicitude.</p>

<p class="indent">The children made their way on tiptoe along
the hall toward the door of the library. Having
paused there and listened, they entered and
groped their way to the far end where the doors
connected this room with the parlor. As they
strained their ears against these barriers, low
sounds reached them from the other side:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg&nbsp;264]</span>
smothered laughter; the noise of things being
taken out of papers; the sound of feet moving
on a step-ladder; the sagging of a laden bough
as it touched other laden boughs. Through
the keyhole there streamed into the darkness of
the library a little shaft of light.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are in there! There is a light in
the room! They&#39;re hanging the presents on!
We&#39;ve caught them!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The leader of the group was about to insert
the key when suddenly upon the intense stillness
there broke a sound; and following upon
that sound what a chorus of noises!</p>

<p class="indent">For at that moment the old house-sentinel
struck twelve&mdash;the Christmas-Night Twelve.
The children had never heard such startling
strokes&mdash;for the natural reason that never
before had they been awake and alone at that
hour. As those twelve loud clear chimes rang
out, the two other guardians of the house
drowsing by the clock, apprehensive after all
regarding the children straying about in the
darkness&mdash;these expressed their uneasiness by
a few low gruff barks, and one followed with a
long questioning howl&mdash;a real Christmas ululation!
Then out in the henhouse a superannuated
rooster drew his long-barrelled single-shooter
out of its feather and leather case,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>[pg&nbsp;265]</span>
cocked it and fired a volley point-blank at the
rafters: the sound seemed made up of drowsiness,
a sore throat, general gallantry, and a
notice that he kept an eye on the sun even when
he had no idea where it was&mdash;the early Christmas
clarion! Further away in the barn a
motherly cow, kept awake by the swayings and
totterings of an infant calf apparently intoxicated
on new milk, stood up on her hind feet
and then on her fore feet and mooed&mdash;quite a
Christmas moo! In a near-by stall an aged
horse who now seemed to recognize what was
expected of him on the occasion struggled to his
fore feet and then to his hind feet, and squaring
himself nickered&mdash;his best Christmas nicker!
Under some straw in a shed a litter of pigs, disposed
with heads and tails as is the packing of
sardines&mdash;except that for the sardines the oil
is poured on the general outside, but for the
pigs it still remained on the individual inside&mdash;these
pigs slept on&mdash;the proper Christmas
indifference! For there had never been any
holy art for them: nor miracles of their manger:
they had merely been good enough to be eaten,
never good enough to be painted! They slept
on while they could!&mdash;mindful of the peril of
ancestral boar&#39;s head and of the modern peril
of brains for breakfast and sausage for supper.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[pg&nbsp;266]</span>
Then on the hearthstone of the library itself
not far from where the children were huddled
the American mouse which is always found there
on Christmas Eve&mdash;this mouse, coming out
and seeing the children, shrieked and scampered&mdash;a
fine Christmas shriek! Whereat on the
opposite side of the hearth a cricket stopped
chirping and dodged over the edge of the brick&mdash;a
clever Christmas dodge!</p>

<p class="indent">All these leaving what a stillness!</p>

<p class="indent">As noiselessly as possible the key was now
inserted, the lock turned, and the door thrown
quickly open; and there on the threshold of
the forbidden room, the children gasped&mdash;baffled&mdash;gazing
into total darkness! The coals
of mystery forever glow even under the ashes in
the human soul; and these coals now sent up in
faint wavering flashes of a burnt-out faith: they
were like the strange delicate wavering Northern
lights above a frozen horizon: after all&mdash;in the
darkness&mdash;amid the hush of the house&mdash;at
the hour of midnight&mdash;with the perfume of
wonderful things wafted thickly to their sense&mdash;after
all, was there not some truth in the Legend?</p>

<p class="indent">Then out of that perfumed darkness a voice
sounded: &quot;Come in if you wish to come in!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And the voice was wonderful, big, deep, merry,
kind&mdash;as though it had but one meaning, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[pg&nbsp;267]</span>
love of the earth&#39;s children; it betokened almighty
justice and impartiality to children.
And it betrayed no surprise or resentment at
being intruded upon. After a while it invited
more persuasively: &quot;Come in if you wish to
come in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And this time it seemed not so much to proceed
from near the Tree as to emanate from the
Tree itself&mdash;to be the Tree speaking!</p>

<p class="indent">The children of the house at once understood
that the nature of their irruption had shifted.
Their father in that disguised voice was issuing
instructions that they were not to dare question
the ancient Christmas rites of the house, nor
attack his sacred office in them. For this hour
he was still to be the Santa Claus of childish
faith. Since they did not believe, they must
make-believe! The scene had instantly been
turned into a house miracle-drama: and they
were as in a theatre: and they were to witness
a play! And the voice did not hesitate an
instant in its exaction of obedience, but at once
entered upon the rôle of a supernatural personage:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was I mistaken? Were not children heard
whispering on the other side of a door, and was
not the door unlocked and thrown open? They
must be there! If they are gone, I am sorry.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>[pg&nbsp;268]</span>
If they are still there&mdash;you children! I&#39;m
glad to see you. Though of course I don&#39;t <i>see</i>
you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;re glad to see you&mdash;though we don&#39;t
see <i>you</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You came just in time. I was about going.
What delayed me&mdash;but strange things have
happened to-night! As I drove up to this
house, suddenly the life seemed to go out of me.
It was never so before. And as I stepped out
of the Sleigh, I felt weary and old. And the
moment I left the reins on the dashboard, my
reindeer, which were trembling with fright of a
new kind, fled with the Sleigh. And now I am
left without knowing when and how I shall get
away. But on a night like this wonderful things
happen; and I may get some signal from them.
A frightened horse will run away from its dismounted
master and then come back to him.
And they may come for me. I may get a signal.
I shall wait. But as I said, I feel strangely lifeless:
and I think I shall sit down. Will you
sit down, please? Where you are, since you
cannot <i>see</i> any chairs,&quot; he said with the sweetest
gayety.</p>

<p class="indent">In the darkness there were the sounds of
laughing delighted children&mdash;grouping themselves
on the floor.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[pg&nbsp;269]</span>
&quot;Now,&quot; said the voice, &quot;I think I&#39;ll come
around to your side of the Tree so that there&#39;ll
be nothing between us!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was coming&mdash;coming as the white-haired
Winter-god, Forest-spirit, of the earth&#39;s children!
They heard him advance around from
behind the Tree, moving to the right; and one
of them who possessed the most sensitive hearing
felt sure that another personage advanced more
softly around from behind the Tree, on the left
side. However this may be, all heard <i>him</i> sit
down, heard the boughs rustle about him as he
worked his thick jolly figure back under them
until they must have hung about his neck and
down over his eyes: then he laughed out as
though he had taken his seat on his true Forest
Throne.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When I am at home in my own country,&quot; he
said, &quot;I am accustomed to sleep with my back
against an evergreen. I believe in your lands you
prefer pine furniture: I like the whole tree.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A tender voice put forth an unexpected question:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you sure that there is not some one with
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is not that a strange question?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah yes, but in the old story when St. Nicholas
arrived, an angel came with him: are you right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg&nbsp;270]</span>
sure there&#39;s not an angel in the room with you
now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I certainly <i>see</i> no angel, though I think I hear
the voice of one! Do you see any angel?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;With my mind&#39;s eye.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That must be the very best eye with which
to see an angel!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But if there were a light in the room&mdash;!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pardon me! If there were a light, I might
not be here myself. If you changed the world
at all, you would change it altogether.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A bolder voice broke in:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re a very mysterious person, are you
not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not more mysterious than you, I should
say. Is there anything more mysterious than
one of you children?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, but that&#39;s a different kind of mysterious:
we don&#39;t pretend to be mysterious: you do!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, do I! You seem to know more about
me than I know about myself. When you have
lived longer, you may not feel so certain about
understanding other people. But then I&#39;m not
people,&quot; he added joyously, and they heard
him push his way further back under the boughs
of the Tree&mdash;withdrawing more deeply into
its mystery.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now then, while I wait, what shall we do?&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>[pg&nbsp;271]</span></p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p class="h2">TIME-SPIRIT AND ETERNAL SPIRIT</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">A</span> hurried whispering began among the children,
and the result was quickly announced:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We should like to ask you some questions.&quot;
Evidently the intention was that questions
should riddle him&mdash;make reasonable daylight
shine through his mysterious pretensions: on
the stage of his own theatre he was to be
stripped.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I treat all children alike,&quot; he replied with
immediate insistence on his divine rights. &quot;And
if any could ask, all should ask. But suppose
every living child asked me a question. That
would be at least a million to every hair on my
head: don&#39;t you think that would make any
head a little heavy? Besides, I&#39;ve always
gotten along so well all over the world because
I have done what I had to do and have never
stopped to talk. As soon as you begin to talk,
don&#39;t you get into trouble&mdash;with somebody?
Who has ever forced a word out of me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[pg&nbsp;272]</span>
How alert he was, nimble, brisk, alive! A
marvellous kind of mental arctic light from him
began to spread through the pitchiness of the
room as from a sun hidden below the horizon.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But everything seems going to pieces tonight,&quot;
he continued; &quot;and maybe I might let
my silence go to pieces also. Your request is
granted&mdash;but&mdash;remember, one question apiece&mdash;the
first each thinks of&mdash;and not quarrelsome:
this is no night for quarrelsome questions!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The lot of asking the first fell naturally to
Elsie, and her question had her history back of
it; the question of each had life-history.</p>

<p class="indent">When Elsie first came to know about the
mysterious Gift-bringer from the North, she
promptly noticed in her sharp way that he was
already old; nor thereafter did he grow older.
She found pictures of him taken generations
before she was born&mdash;and there he was just as
old! She judged him to be about fifty-five years
or sixty as compared with middle-aged Kentucky
farmers, some of whom were heavy-set men like
him with florid complexions, and with snow on
their beards and hair, and mischievous eyes and
the same high spirits. Only, there was one who
had no spirits at all except the very lowest.
This was a deacon of the country church, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg&nbsp;273]</span>
instead of giving presents to the children once a
year pushed a long-handled box at them every
Sunday and tried to force them to make presents
to him! One hot morning of early summer&mdash;he
had so annoyed her&mdash;when the box again
paused tantalizingly in front of her, she had
shot out a plump little hand and dropped into
it a frantic indignant June bug which presently
raised a hymn for the whole congregation. She
hated the deacon furthermore because he resembled
Santa Claus, and she disliked Santa
Claus because he resembled the deacon: she
held them responsible for resembling each other.
All this was long ago in her short life, but the
ancient grudge was still lodged in her mind,
and it now came out in her question:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why did you wait to get old before you
began to bring presents to children; why didn&#39;t
you bestir yourself earlier; and what were you
doing all the years when you were young?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">If you could have believed that trees laughed,
you would have said that the Christmas Fir
was laughing now.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is a very good question, but it is not
very simple, I am sorry to say; and by my word
I am bound not to answer it; you were told that
the question must be simple! However, I am
willing to make you a promise: I do not know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[pg&nbsp;274]</span>
where I may be next year, but wherever you are,
you will receive, I hope, a little book called
<i>Santa Claus in the Days of his Youth</i>. I hope
you will find your question answered there to
your satisfaction. And now&mdash;for the next.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">During the years of Elizabeth&#39;s belief in the
great Legend of the North, second to her delight
in the coming of the gifts was sorrow at the going
of them. Every year an avalanche of beautiful
things flowed downward over the world, across
mountain ranges, across valleys and rivers; and
each house chimney received its share from the
one vast avalanche. Every year! And for all
she knew these avalanches had been in motion
thousands of years. But where were the gifts?
Gone, melted away; so that there were now
no more at the end of time than there had been
at the beginning. The fate of the vanished lay
tenderly over the landscape of the world for her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You say that one night of every winter you
drive round the earth in your sleigh, carrying
presents. Every summer don&#39;t you disguise
yourself and drive over the same track in an
old cart and gather them up again? Many a
summer day I have watched you without your
knowing it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This time you could have believed that if
evergreens are sensitive, the fir now stood with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg&nbsp;275]</span>
its boughs lowered a little pensively and very
still.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sorry! The question violates the same
mischief-making rule, and by my word I am
bound not to answer it. But it is as easy to give
a promise to two as to one; next year I hope you
will receive a little book called <i>Santa Claus with
the Wounded and the Lost</i>. And I wish you joy
in that story. Now then!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father told me not to ask any questions
while I was over here: to wait and ask <i>him</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The little theatre of make-believe almost
crumbled to its foundations beneath that one
touch of reality! The great personage of the
drama lost control of his resources for a moment.
Then the little miracle-play was successfully
resumed:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, then, I won&#39;t have to answer any questions
for you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I can tell you what I was <i>going</i> to ask!
I was going to ask you if you are married. And
if you are, why you travel always without your
wife. I was wondering whether you didn&#39;t like
<i>your</i> wife!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The answer came like a blinding flash&mdash;like a
flash meant to extinguish another flash:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A book, a book! Another book! There
will have to be another book! Look out for one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg&nbsp;276]</span>
next Christmas, dropped down the chimney
especially for you: and I hope it won&#39;t fall into
the fire or into the soot&mdash;<i>Santa Claus and</i> his
<i>Wife</i>. Now then&mdash;time flies!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">During the infantile years when the heir of the
house had been a believer in the figure beside the
Tree, there had always been one point he jealously
weighed: whether children of white complexion
were not entitled to a larger share of
Christmas bounty than those of red or yellow
or brown or black faces; and in particular
whether among all white children those native
to the United States ought not to receive highest
consideration. The old question now rang out:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do <i>you</i> think of the immigrants?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Tree did not exactly laugh aloud, but it
certainly laughed all over&mdash;with hearty wholesome
approving laughter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That question is the worst offender of all; it
is quarrelsome! It is the most quarrelsome
question that could be asked. What are immigrants
to me? But next year look out for a
book called <i>Santa Claus on Immigrants</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Put plenty of gore in it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gore! Gore on Christmas Eve! But if
there was gore, since it is in a book, it would have
to be dry gore. But wouldn&#39;t salve be better&mdash;salve
for old wounds?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg&nbsp;277]</span>
&quot;If you&#39;re going to put salve in, you might
use my Waterloo salve!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t be peculiar, Herbert&mdash;especially
away from home!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Certainly the Tree was shaken with laughter
this time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;See what things grow to when once started;
here were four questions, and now they fill four
books. But time flies. Now I must make
haste! My reindeer!&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His ingenuity was evidently at work upon
this pretext as perhaps furnishing him later on
a way through which he might effect his escape:
in this little theatre of thin illusion there must
be some rear exit; and through this he hoped
to retire from the stage without losing his dignity
and the illusion of his rôle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My reindeer,&quot; he insisted, holding fast to
that clew for whatsoever it might lead him to,
&quot;if they should rush by for me, I must be ready.
A faint distant signal&mdash;and I&#39;m gone! So before
I go, in return for your questions I am going
to ask you one. But first there is a little story&mdash;my
last story; and I beg you to listen to it.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">After a pause he began:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Listen, you children! You children of this
house, you children of the world!</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg&nbsp;278]</span>
&quot;You love the snow. You play in it, you
hunt in it; it brings the melody of sleigh-bells,
it gives white wings to the trees and new robes
to the earth. Whenever it falls on the roof of
this house and in the yard and upon the farm,
sooner or later it vanishes; it is forever rising
and falling, forming and melting&mdash;on and on
through the ages.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you should start from your home to-night
and travel northward, after a while you would
find everything steadily changing: the atmosphere
growing colder, living creatures beginning
to be left behind, those that remain beginning
to look white, the voices of the earth
beginning to die out: color fading, song failing.
As you journeyed on always you would be
travelling toward the silent, the white, the dead.
And at last you would come to a land of no sun
and of all silence except the noise of wind and
ice; you would have entered the kingdom of
eternal snow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If from your home you should start southward,
as you crossed land after land in the same
way, you would begin to see that life was failing
and the harmonies of the planet replaced by
the discord of lifeless forces&mdash;storming, crushing,
grinding. And at last you would reach
the threshold of another world that you dared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[pg&nbsp;279]</span>
not enter and that nothing alive ever faces:
the home of perpetual frost.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you should rise straight into the air from
your housetop as though you were climbing
the side of a mountain, you would find at last
that you had ascended to a height where the
mountain would be capped forever with snow.
For all round the earth wherever its mountains
are high enough, their summits are capped with
the one same snow: above us all everywhere
lies the upper land of eternal cold.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sometime in the future&mdash;we do not know
when&mdash;the spirit of cold at the north will
move southward; the spirit of cold at the south
will move northward; the spirit of cold in the
upper air will move downward; and the three
will meet, and for the earth there will be one
whiteness and silence&mdash;rest.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Little children, the earth is burning out like a
bedroom candle. The great sun is but a longer
candle that burns out also. All the stars are
but candles that one by one go out in the darkness
of the universe. Now tell me, you children
of this house, you children of the earth, for I
make no difference among you and ask each the
same question: when the earth and the sun and
the stars are burnt out like your bedroom
candles, where in that darkness will you be?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[pg&nbsp;280]</span>
Where will all the children of the earth be
then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And now at last the Great Solemn Night drew
apart its curtains of mystery and revealed its
spiritual summit.</p>

<p class="indent">Out of these ordinary American children had
all but died the last vestiges of the superstitions
of their time and of earlier ages. They were
new children of a new land in a new time; and
they were the voices of fresh millions&mdash;voices
that rose and floated far and wide as a revelation
of the spirit of man stripped of worn-out
rags and standing forth in its divine nakedness&mdash;wingèd
and immortal.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know where I shall be,&quot; said the lad whose
ideal of this life turned toward strength that
would not fail and truth that could not waver.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know where I shall be,&quot; said the little soul
whose earthly ideal was selfishness: who had
within herself humanity&#39;s ideal that hereafter
somewhere in the universe all desires will be
gratified.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know where I shall be,&quot; said the little soul
whose earthly ideal was the quieting of the
world&#39;s pain: who had vague notions of a land
where none would be sick and none suffer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know where I shall be,&quot; said the little soul
whose ideal of life was the gathering and keeping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg&nbsp;281]</span>
of all beautiful things that none should be lost
and that none should change.</p>

<p class="indent">Then in the same spirit in which the group of
them had carried on their drama of the night
they now asked him:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where will <i>you</i> be?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a while there was no answer, and when at
length the answer came it was low indeed:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wherever the earth&#39;s children are, may I be
there with them!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As the vast modern cathedral organ can be
traced back through centuries to the throat of
a dry reed shaken with its fellows by the wind
on the banks of some ancient river, so out of the
throats of these children began once more the
chant of ages-that deep majestical organ-roll
of humanity.</p>

<p class="indent">The darkened parlor of the Kentucky farmhouse
became the plain where shepherds watched
their flocks&mdash;it became the Mount of Transfiguration&mdash;it
became Calvary&mdash;it became
the Apocalypse. It became the chorus out of
all lands, out of all ages:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>And there were shepherds&mdash;The Lord is my
shepherd&mdash;Unto us a child is born&mdash;I know
that my Redeemer liveth&mdash;I know in whom I have
believed&mdash;In my Father&#39;s house are many mansions&mdash;I
go to prepare a place for you&mdash;Where</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg&nbsp;282]</span>
<i>I am you may be also&mdash;The earth shall pass
away, but my word will not pass away&mdash;Now is
Christ risen from the dead&mdash;Trailing clouds of
glory do we come from God Who is our home&mdash;Thou
wilt not leave us in the dust&mdash;Sunset
and evening star, and one clear call for me&mdash;My
Pilot face to face when I have crost the bar&mdash;</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In the room was the spiritual hymn of the
whole earth from the beginning until now: that
somewhere in the universe there is a Father and
a Fatherland; that on a dying planet under a
dying sun amid myriads of dying stars there is
something that does not die&mdash;the Youth of
Man. In that youth all that had been best in
him will come to fullest life; all that was worst
will have dropped away.</p>

<p class="indent">The room was very still awhile.</p>

<p class="indent">Then upon its intense stillness there broke a
sound&mdash;faint, far away through the snow-thickened
air&mdash;a melody of coming sleigh-bells.
All heard, all listened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hark, hark! Do you hear! Listen! They
are coming for me! They&#39;re coming!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Tree shook as he who was sitting under
its branches rose to his feet with these words.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is father&#39;s sleigh: I know those bells:
those are our sleigh-bells. That is father!&quot;
said a grave boy excitedly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg&nbsp;283]</span>
&quot;Ah! Is that what <i>you</i> think <i>I</i> hear! Then
indeed it is time for me to be going!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a rustling of the boughs of the
Christmas Tree as though the guest were
leaving.</p>

<p class="indent">Nearer, nearer, nearer, along the turnpike
came the sound of the bells. At the front gate
the sound suddenly ceased.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They&#39;re waiting for me!&quot; said a voice from
behind the Tree as it moved away in the direction
of the chimney.</p>

<p class="indent">Then all heard something more startling still.</p>

<p class="indent">The sleigh was approaching the house. Out
of the silence and the darkness of Christmas
Eve there was travelling toward the house another
story&mdash;the drama of a man&#39;s life.</p>

<p class="indent">At the distance of a few hundred yards the
sound of the sleigh-bells, borne softly into the
room and to the rapt listeners, showed that the
driver had turned out of the main drive and
begun to encircle the house by that path which
enclosed it as within a ring&mdash;within the symbol
of the eternal.</p>

<p class="indent">Under old trees now snow-laden, past the
flower-beds of summer, past the long branches
of flowering shrubs and of roses that no longer
scattered their petals, but now dropped the
flowers of the sky, past thoughts and memories,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[pg&nbsp;284]</span>
it made its way: as for one who doubles back
upon the track of experience with a new purpose
and revisits the past as he turns away from it
toward another future. Through the darkness,
across the fresh snow, on this night of the anniversary
of home life, there and on this final
Christmas Eve after which all would soon vanish,
he drew this band&mdash;binding together all the
lives there grouped&mdash;putting about them the
ring of oneness.</p>

<p class="indent">That mournful melody of secrecy and darkness
began to die out. Fainter and fainter it
pulsed through the air. At the gate it was
barely heard and then it was not heard: was
it gone or was it waiting there?</p>

<p class="indent">By the chimney-side there were faint noises.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is gone!&quot; whispered Elizabeth with one
intense breath.</p>

<h2>V</h2>

<p class="h2">WHEN A FATHER FINDS OUT ABOUT A SON</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Christmas</span> had passed, bringing up the train
of its predecessors&mdash;the merry and sad parade
of the years.</p>

<p class="indent">It departed a little changed, and it left the
whole world a little changed by the new work of
new children&mdash;by that innumerable army of
the young who are ever usurping the earth from
the old; who successively refashion it in their
own image, and in turn growing old themselves
leave it to the young again to refashion still
further: leaving it always to the child, the destroyer
and saviour of the race.</p>

<p class="indent">And yet it is the Child that amid all changes
believes that it will escape all change.</p>

<p class="indent">Christmas had passed, and human nature had
settled once more to routine and commonplace,
starting to travel across another restful desert
of ordinary days before it should reach another
exhausting oasis of the unusual. The young
broke or threw away or forgot their toys; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[pg&nbsp;286]</span>
old lifted once more to their backs familiar burdens
with a kind of fretful or patient liking for
them.</p>

<p class="indent">The sun began to return with his fresh and
ancient smiling. For a while after Christmas
snows were deeper and dryer, but then began to
fall more rarely and melt more swiftly. February
turned its unfinished work over to March,
and March received it, and among other things
brought to its service winds and daffodils. The
last flakes of snow as they sank through the sod
passed the snowdrop pushing upward&mdash;the
passing of the snowdrops of winter and of spring.
In the woods wherever there was mistletoe&mdash;that
undying pledge of verdure into which
naturalists of old believed that the whole spirit
of the tree had retreated for safety from the
storm&mdash;wherever there was mistletoe, it began
to withdraw from sight and hide itself amid
young leaves bursting forth everywhere&mdash;universal
annunciation that what had seemed
dead yet lived. Out of the ground things
sprouted and rose that had never lived before;
but on old stocks also, as on the tops of old trees
about the doctor&#39;s house, equally there was
spring. For while there is life, there is youth;
and as long as there is youth, there is growth.
Life is youth, wholly youth; and death is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[pg&nbsp;287]</span>
the end of age nor of old age, but only the ending
of youth: of briefer youth or extended youth,
but always of youth.</p>

<p class="indent">Ploughing began in the Kentucky fields, and
after the plough the sower went forth to sow.
Dr. Birney as he drove along turnpikes and
lanes looked out of his buggy and saw him. Beside
him was his son, and the doctor was busy
sowing also, sowing the seeds of right suggestion.
Sometimes they met child patients whom the
doctor had brought through the epidemic, they
stopped and chatted triumphantly.</p>

<p class="indent">Altogether it was springtime for the doctor
for more reasons than one. There was a change
in him. He looked younger and he was younger.
The weight as of a glacier had melted away
from him. A new verdure of joy started forth.
The beauty and happiness of the country about
him found counterpart and response in his own
nature.</p>

<p class="indent">One day as the two were driving across a fine
growing landscape the doctor was trying to impart
a larger idea of service; and so he was
saying that there were three fathers: he was the
first father&mdash;to be looked to for counsel and
guidance and protection: this father was to be
served loyally; he must be fought for if there
were need, died for. But by and by the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[pg&nbsp;288]</span>
father would step aside and a second take his
place, much greater, more powerful&mdash;the
fatherland. For this second father also his
listener must be ready to fight, to die; he must
look to it for guidance and safety. Then again
in time the second father would disappear and
the third Father would take him in hand&mdash;the
Father of all things.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And then I&#39;ll have to fight and die for the
third Father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not so sure about the fighting and the
dying,&quot; said the doctor with a quick, happy
laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And after the third Father&mdash;who gets me
next? When He is done with me, then what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not so sure about that, either,&quot; admitted
the doctor. &quot;The third Father will keep
you a long time; and as all the troops are his,
there may be nobody to fight: but He&#39;ll make
you a good soldier!&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Thus during these days, each in his own way
was putting forth new growth; and now there
arrived a morning when the son was to show
how well grown he was and how faithfully
things sown in him were maturing.</p>

<p class="indent">At breakfast for some lack of fine manners he
received instructions from his mother. By way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[pg&nbsp;289]</span>
of grateful acknowledgment, he laid down his
knife and fork and stiffened his back against
his chair and looked at her steadily:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t see what you have to do with my
manners,&quot; he said, as though the opportunity
had come at last for him to speak his mind on
the family situation. &quot;You&#39;ve spoiled everything
for us. You ought never to have been
my mother. Mrs. Ousley ought to have been
my mother.&quot; And then he looked at his father
for approval that he had brought the truth out
at last.</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor at the beginning of that utterance
had started toward him with the quick movement
of one who tries to shut a door through which a
hurricane has begun to rush. Now without a
word he rose from the table and grasping the boy
by the wrist led him from the room.</p>

<p class="indent">As the door closed behind them, a loud ringing
laugh was heard as though the two were going off
to enjoy something together. Then another door
was closed, and then there resounded through the
silence of all the rooms a loud startled scream;
not so much of pain but of bewilderment, of
amazement, of grief of mind, of a puzzle in the
brain. Then there were other sounds, other
sounds, other sounds. And then one long continued
sound&mdash;low, piteous, inconsolable.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>[pg&nbsp;290]</span>
The spring advanced; tide of new life overflowed
the land. Dr. Birney and his boy were
seen driving on all bright days: not toward the
sick necessarily; sometimes they were on their
way to a creek or pond to fish.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a tragic change in the doctor, and
there was a grave change in his son. The father&#39;s
face began to show the responsibility of handling
a case that was becoming more difficult; on a
landscape of growing things&mdash;growing with the
irresistible force of Nature, how was he to arrest
the growth of things in the nature of a child?
And the boy was beginning in his way to consider
the danger of too much devotion to a
father, too blind an imitation of him. In his
way he was trying to get clear hold of this problem
of how to imitate and how not to imitate.
Something was gone between them; not affection,
but peace. Each was puzzled by the other,
and each knew the other was puzzled. How
completely they jerked shining fish out of the
lucent water; but as each dropped his hook into
the sea of character, neither felt assured what
he might draw up. At times in the doctor&#39;s eyes
there was an expression too sad to be seen in
any father&#39;s; and in the boy&#39;s was the look of
the first deterioration in life&mdash;the defeat of being
punished for what he thought was right.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>[pg&nbsp;291]</span>
Late one cold rainy afternoon in April there
were several buggies in Dr. Birney&#39;s yard, three
of them belonging to physicians called into
consultation from adjoining county seats. One
of the phenomena which baffle the science of
medicine had appeared on the doctor&#39;s threshold&mdash;the
sporadic case. Long after an epidemic
is over, by an untraceable path infection arrives.
It is quite as if a bird that cannot migrate should
be found unearned on the opposite coast of a sea.</p>

<p class="indent">There was little need of the consultation; the
disease was well known, the treatment was that
agreed upon by the profession; Dr. Birney himself
was the most successful practitioner. A
well-known disease, an agreed-upon treatment&mdash;but
a rate of mortality.</p>

<p class="indent">Others came, not called: friends, neighbors,
members of his Masonic order. During all
these years he had slowly won the heart of the
whole people, and now it turned to him.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The doctor watched the progress of the case
like one who must now bring to bear the resources
of a lifetime and of a life; who must
cast the total of skill and of influence on the side
of the vital forces.</p>

<p class="indent">As the disease ran on in its course, to him
it became more and more a question of how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>[pg&nbsp;292]</span>
the issue would turn upon so-called little things,
as the recovery of a patient is probably sometimes
secured by merely turning him from side
to side, from back to stomach.</p>

<p class="indent">It was his problem how to drop into one scale
or the other scale of the childish balances some
almost imponderable weight, as when good tidings
arriving save a life, as when bad news held
back saves a life; as when the removal of an
injustice from a sensitive spirit saves a life; as
when the healing of a wound of the mind in the
very extremity saves a life.</p>

<p class="indent">He felt that before him now were oscillating
those delicate balances, never quite in equilibrium:
a joy dropped into one, a sorrow dropped
into the other&mdash;some pennyweight of new
peace, some grain of additional worry! The
shadows collected on one side, sunbeams
gathered on the other.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now then,&quot; he thought within himself,
&quot;now then is the hour when I must be sunlight
to him&mdash;not shadow!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He watched the look in his little boy&#39;s eyes;
he noted the presence of things weighing heavily.
There was a tangle, a perplexity, a tossing
of the head from side to side on the pillow&mdash;as
if to turn quickly away from things seen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do I cast a light on him? Do I cast a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[pg&nbsp;293]</span>
shadow? Does my presence here by him bring
tranquillity, rest, sound sleep? As he sees into
me, does what he sees strengthen? Was his
chastisement that morning a sunbeam? It had
not struck him like a sunbeam; it had not fallen
in that way! The chill in the house all these
years&mdash;had that been vital warmth to him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There now came out the meaning of all that
exaggeratedly careful training: the exercise, the
outdoor life, everything: it was the attempt to
develop robust health on a foundation not
robust: everything went back to the poor start:
each child had been born delicate.</p>

<p class="indent">At intervals during the illness there were bits
of talk. One night the doctor rose from the
bedside and brought a glass of pure fresh water
and administered a spoonful and watched the
swallowing and the expression:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does it taste bitter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pretty bitter. You can&#39;t say that I didn&#39;t
take your nasty old doses, can you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t talk! You mustn&#39;t talk.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;d feel better if I did talk&mdash;if I could get
it out of me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then talk! What is it? Out with it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the face was jerked quickly away with
that motion of wishing to look in another direction.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[pg&nbsp;294]</span>
Some nights there was delirium. Through
the brain rolled clouds of fantasies:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>... If I knew how it comes out between you
and Mrs. Ousley....</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On these dark rolling clouds the father tried
to throw a beam of peace: and it was no moment
to hold back any of the truth:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>It is all over!... There is nothing of it.</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>I wish I had known it sooner: it bothered
me....</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At another time more fantasies:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>... Not on the cheek! You&#39;re no father
of mine if it&#39;s on the cheek....</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At another time:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;... <i>Suppose I never grow up and Elizabeth
does. How is that? I wouldn&#39;t like that.
How do you straighten that out?</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>I can&#39;t straighten that out.</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Then I can&#39;t straighten it out, either.</i>&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">&quot;So young&mdash;so young!&quot; muttered the doctor.
&quot;I was pretty old!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">One warm night the doctor walked out of
doors. The south wind blew softly in his face,
lifting his hair.</p>

<p class="indent">All round the house in yard and garden and
farther away in the woods and fields everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>[pg&nbsp;295]</span>
was growing. It was a night when the earth
seemed given up to the festival of youth: it
was the hour of youth: of its triumph in
Nature.</p>

<p class="indent">Little aware of where his feet carried him, he
was now in the garden and now in the yard.
And in the garden, low down, how sturdy little
things were growing: the little radishes, the
young beets, the beans&mdash;those children of the
earth, flawless in their descent and environment&mdash;with
what unarrestable force they were
growing! Afterwards in the yard he passed
some beds of lilies of the valley&mdash;most delicate
breath of all flowers: how fragile but how
strong, how safe in their unsullied parentage, in
their ample wedlock!</p>

<p class="indent">All about the house the steady rush of the
young! And within it&mdash;as a mausoleum&mdash;the
youth of all youth for him&mdash;stopped!</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Most obedient and well-trained and irresponsible
Death! Thou hast no grudge against us
nor bearest toward any of us malice nor ill-will!
Thou stayest away as long as thou canst and
never comest till thou must! Thou visitant
without will of thine own! Quickening Death,
that also givest to the will of another not the
shock of death, but the shock of new life!</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[pg&nbsp;296]</span>
There loomed in the darkness before the
doctor as he wandered about a true picture:
an ancient people in an ancient land weighed
upon by their transgressions which they could
neither transfer to one another nor lay upon
mother earth. So once a year one of them in
behalf of himself and the rest chose an exemplar
of their faithful flocks and herds, and folding
his hands upon its head laid upon it the burden
of guilt and shame, and then had it led out of
the camp&mdash;to wild waste places where no one
dwelt&mdash;&quot;<i>to a land not inhabited</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">... And now he had sent away his son into
the eternal with his own life faults and failings
on him....</p>

<p class="indent">He turned back into the house&mdash;passed
through the sick room&mdash;passed through his
library, passed the portrait of his wife in her
bridal veil&mdash;passed down the hall&mdash;knocked
at her door and opened it wide and stood in the
opening:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;... My wife, I have come to you...!
Will you come to him...?&quot;</p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<p class="h2">LIVING OUT THE YEARS</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">An</span> afternoon of early summer, at the edge of
a quiet Kentucky town, on the slope of a grassy
hillside within one of those dreamy enclosures
where our earthly dreams are ended, the sunlight
began to descend slantingly for the first
time&mdash;as on white silvery wings&mdash;upon a
newly placed memorial for a child. Across the
top of the memorial was carved a single legend
hoary with the guilt and shame of men and
women of centuries long since gone. Beside
the memorial stood a young evergreen as the
living forest substitute of him sleeping below:
it was of about his age and height. The ancient
stone with its legend of atonement and the
young tree thus brought together stood there
as if the offending and the innocent had come
to one of their meeting-places&mdash;and in life they
meet so often.</p>

<p class="indent">Tree and mound and marble stood within an
open enclosure of turf encircled at a score of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>[pg&nbsp;298]</span>
yards by old evergreens touching one another.</p>

<p class="indent">Early in the afternoon two of these evergreens
had some of their lower interlapping boughs
softly pushed apart, and into the open space
there stepped excitedly a frail little figure in
a frock of forget-me-not blue. Just inside the
boughs which folded behind her like living doors
so that she was screened from view, she hesitated
for a moment and looked about her for the
dreaded spot which she knew she was doomed
to find. Having located it, she advanced with
uncertain footsteps as though there could be no
straight path for her to the scene of such a loss.</p>

<p class="indent">When she reached it, she sat hurriedly down,
dropped her bouquet on the grass beside herself,
jerked off her spectacles and pressing her hands
to her eyes, burst into an agony of weeping.
Long she sat there, helpless in her anguish.
Once holding her hand before her eyes, she drew
from her pocket a fresh handkerchief; she had
brought two: she knew her tears would be many.</p>

<p class="indent">At last she dried her red swollen eyes and
brushed back from her temples the long sunny
strands of wind-woven hair; she put on her
glasses and picked up her little round brilliant
country picnic bouquet; and with quivering
lips and quivering nostrils looked where she must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>[pg&nbsp;299]</span>
place it. With tear-wet forefinger and thumb
she forced the flowers apart on one side and
peeped at the card pushed deep within within&mdash;&quot;From
Elizabeth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She got up then and went slowly away, fading
out behind the pines like a little wandering strip
of heaven&#39;s remembering blue.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Later in the afternoon the sound of slowly
approaching wheels sounded on the gravel of
the drive that wound near: then a carriage
stopped. A minute afterwards there appeared
within the open enclosure a woman in black,
thickly veiled, bringing an armful of flowers.
Some yards behind her a man followed in deep
mourning also, bareheaded, his hat in his hand
at his side&mdash;the soldierly figure of a man squaring
himself against adversity, but stricken and
bowed at his post. They did not advance side
by side as those who walk most in unison when
they are most bereaved and draw closer together
as fate draws nearer.</p>

<p class="indent">When she reached the mound, she turned
toward him and waited; and when he came up,
without a word she held the flowers out to him.
She held them out to him with silence and with
what a face under her veil&mdash;with what a look
out of the wife&#39;s and mother&#39;s eyes&mdash;there was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>[pg&nbsp;300]</span>
none to see. He gently pushed the flowers back
toward her, mutely asking of her some charity
for the sake of all; so that, consenting, she
turned to arrange them. As she did so, she
became conscious at last of what hitherto she
had perceived with her eyes only: the happy
little bouquet of a child left on the sod. And
suddenly there fell upon her veil and hung enmeshed
in it some heavy tears, of which, however,
she took no notice. But she disposed the
flowers so that they would not interfere with&mdash;not
quite reach to&mdash;that token of a child&#39;s
love which had never known and now would
never know time&#39;s disillusion or earth&#39;s disenchantment.</p>

<p class="indent">When she had finished, she remained standing
looking at it all. He moved around to her side;
and they both with final impulse let their eyes
meet upon the ancient line chiselled across the
marble:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&quot;<span class="cursive">Unto a Land Not Inhabited.</span>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He broke the silence:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I chose that for him: it is the truth: he
has been sent away, bearing more than was his.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She looked at it a long time, and then bowed
as if to set the seal of her judgment upon the
seal of his judgment. And, moved by some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[pg&nbsp;301]</span>
pitiless instinct to look at things as they are,&mdash;the
discipline of her years,&mdash;with a quiet resolute
hand she lifted her veil away from her
face. It was a face of that proud and self-ennobled
beauty that anywhere in the world
gives to the beholder of it a lesson in the sublimer
elements of human character. There was no
feature of reproach nor line nor shadow of bitterness,
but the chastened peace of a nature that
has learned to live upon itself, after having first
cast itself passionately upon others; and that
indestructible strength which rests not upon
what life can give, but upon what life cannot
take away: she stood revealed there as what in
truth she was&mdash;heroic daughter of the greater
vanished people.</p>

<p class="indent">She dropped her veil and turned away toward
the carriage. He drew to her side and once&mdash;hesitatingly,
desolately&mdash;he put his arm around
her. She did not yield, she did not decline; she
walked with him as though she walked alone.
During all the barren bitter years she had not
been upheld by his arm: her staff and her
support had been her ideal of herself and of her
people&mdash;after she had faced the ruined ideal of
their lives together and her lost ideal of him.
It was yet too soon for his arm&mdash;or it was too
late altogether.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>[pg&nbsp;302]</span>
He withdrew it; and he continued to walk
beside her as a man who has lost among women
both her whom he had most wished to have and
her whom he might most have had. And so
they passed from the scene.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">But throughout that long obscurity amid
which we are appointed to pass our allotted
years, it is not the order of nature that all stars
within us should rise at once. There are some
that are seen early, that move rapidly across
our sky, and are beheld no more&mdash;youth&#39;s
flaming planets, the influence of which upon us
often leaves us doubting whether they were
baneful or benign. There are other lights which
come out to shine upon our paths and guide us
later; and, thanks be to nature, until the very
last new stars appear. Those who early have
left them they love can never know what late
radiance may illumine the end of their road.
And only those who remain together to the end
can greet the last splendid beacons that sometimes
rise above the horizon before the dawn&mdash;the
true morning stars of many a dark and
troubled life.</p>

<p class="indent">They had half their lives before them: they
were growing, unfolding characters; perhaps
they were yet to find happiness together. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>[pg&nbsp;303]</span>
had loved him with a love too single and complete,
and she loved him yet too well, to accept
anything from him a second time less than
everything. Happiness was in store for them
perhaps&mdash;and more children.</p>

<p class="indent">The working out of this lay with them and
their remaining days.</p>

<p class="indent">But for the doctor one thing had been worked
out to the end: that year by year he was to
drive along turnpikes and lanes&mdash;alone. That
every spring he was to see the sower go forth
in the fields; that with his whitening hair he
was to watch beside the beds of sick children;
and often at night under his lamp to fall asleep
with his eyes fixed upon The World&#39;s Path of
Lessening Pain.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">When the two were gone, it was a still spot
that afternoon with the sunlight on the grass.
As the sun began to descend, its rays gradually
left the earth and passed upward toward the
pinnacles of the pines; and lingering on those
summits awhile, it finally took its flight back
to the infinite. Twilight fell gray; darkness
began to brood; objects lost their outlines.
The trees of the enclosure became shadows;

<p>The Bride of the Mistletoe</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">To which <i>The Doctor&#39;s Christmas Eve</i> is a sequel, was
described at the time of its publication as &quot;<i>so exquisite
that not a few of his admirers will hold it the best work
he has accomplished</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It stands out in the midst of the year&#39;s fiction, and
perhaps the fiction of many years, as a thing by itself.
There is the spirit of Maeterlinck in these pages blended
with the spirit of Hawthorne.&quot;&mdash;<i>Current Literature.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The English press was enthusiastic, the London <i>Academy</i>
declaring it &quot;worth very many ordinary novels&quot;; &quot;conceived
in a fine vision and developed with beauty&quot;;
&quot;exercising over us a strong and at times a weird
fascination.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>Literary World</i> sums up: &quot;We may assure the
author&#39;s innumerable readers and friends that in his
latest book he has lost none of the charm that first
won them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Exquisite in form, full of color, finely finished.&quot; <span class="ralign">&mdash;<i>Record-Herald</i>, Chicago.</span></p>

<p>The Choir Invisible</p>

<p class="margin-left8"><i>This can also be had in a special edition<br />
illustrated by Orson Lowell</i> <span class="ralign"><i>$2.50</i></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;One reads the story for the story&#39;s sake, and then re-reads
the book out of pure delight in its beauty. The story is American
to the very core.... Mr. Allen stands to-day in the
front rank of American novelists. <i>The Choir Invisible</i> will
solidify a reputation already established and bring into clear
light his rare gifts as an artist. For this latest story is as
genuine a work of art as has come from an American hand.&quot;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hamilton

<p>The Reign of Law <span class="ralign">A Tale of the Kentucky Hempfields</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Allen has a style as original and almost as perfectly
finished as Hawthorne&#39;s, and he has also Hawthorne&#39;s fondness
for spiritual suggestion that makes all his stories rich
in the qualities that are lacking in so many novels of the
period.... If read in the right way, it cannot fail to add
to one&#39;s spiritual possessions.&quot;&mdash;<i>San Francisco Chronicle.<br />

<p>The Mettle of the Pasture</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;It may be that <i>The Mettle of the Pasture</i> will live and become
a part of our literature; it certainly will live far beyond the
allotted term of present-day fiction. Our principal concern is
that it is a notable novel, that it ranks high in the range of
American and English fiction, and that it is worth the reading,
the re-reading, and the continuous appreciation of those who
care for modern literature at its best.&quot;&mdash;E.F.E. in the <i>Boston
Transcript. <span class="ralign">Cloth, 12mo, $1.50</span></i></p>

<p>Summer in Arcady <span class="ralign">A Tale of Nature</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;This story by James Lane Allen is one of the gems of the
season. It is artistic in its setting, realistic and true to nature
and life in its descriptions, dramatic, pathetic, tragic, in its
incidents; indeed, a veritable masterpiece that must become
classic. It is difficult to give an outline of the story; it is one
of the stories which do not outline; it must be read.&quot;&mdash;<i>Boston
Daily Advertiser. <span class="ralign">Cloth, $1.25</span></i></p>

<p>The Blue Grass Region of Kentucky</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;The simple, rural key-note of life is still the sweetest,&#39; he
had written in the opening pages of <i>The Blue Grass Region
of Kentucky</i>; and it is this note which, played on the pipes
of Pan in ever-recurring and fresh variations, yields the sweetest
music, and, touched with the breath of his passion for nature,
is transmuted into those &#39;invisible flowers of sound&#39; which lie
pressed between his pages.&quot;&mdash;<i>The Bookman.<br />

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;He takes us into a green and fragrant world in that Kentucky
home of his which he has shared with us so genially and delightfully
before now. No one has made more of a native
region than he&mdash;more beauty and more attractiveness. He
has done for the blue grass country what Miss Wilkins has
done for New England, what Hamlin Garland has done for
some parts of the West.&quot;&mdash;<i>Boston Transcript.<br />

<p>A Kentucky Cardinal</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;A narrative, told with naive simplicity in the first person, of
how a man who was devoted to his fruits and flowers and birds
came to fall in love with a fair neighbor who treated him at
first with whimsical raillery and coquetry, and who finally put
his love to the supreme test.&quot;&mdash;<i>New York Tribune. <span class="ralign">Cloth, 12mo, illustrated, $1.00</span></i></p>
